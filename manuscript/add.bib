bookTitle="Biochemical Interaction Between Plants and Insects",
year="1976",
publisher="Springer US",
address="Boston, MA",
pages="1--40",
abstract="A major objective of insect ecology is to explain observed patterns of interaction between plants and herbivorous insects. We would like to understand both how such patterns are maintained in ecological time and also how they have come about in evolutionary time. A test of how far such understanding has progressed will be our ability to predict how patterns vary from one kind of community to another and how they will change when subjected to natural or human disturbance.",
