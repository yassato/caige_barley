	abstract = {The foraging behavior of butterflies and bumblebees is compared on the same populations of three Senecio species. While bumblebees typically fly near-neighbor distances, resulting in very localized pollen dispersal, butterflies frequently bypass nearby plants, flying significantly greater distances between plants. Bumblebees visit significantly more heads per plant and significantly more plants per foraging bout. The flight distance distribution data are used to calculate neighborhood size and area, in the sense of Wright's isolation-by-distance model, for the observed populations under hypothetical conditions of exclusive butterfly or exclusive bumblebee pollination. It is predicted that small neighborhood sizes will typically be found in plant populations specializing on bumblebee pollination, whereas butterfly-pollinated populations will have much larger neighborhood sizes; bumblebee-pollinated plants will therefore have greater potential for local genetic differentiation. These differences in neighborhood characteristics may be augmented if plants are self-compatible or if pollen carryover occurs, since bumblebees make a higher proportion of intraplant flights. The addition of a small amount of butterfly pollination can increase gene dispersal in a plant population sufficiently to greatly reduce genetic drift and microgeographic adaptive differentiation.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Meta‐analysis has contributed substantially to shifting paradigms in ecology and has become the primary method for quantitatively synthesizing published research. However, an emerging challenge is the lack of a statistical protocol to synthesize studies and evaluate sources of bias while simultaneously accounting for phylogenetic nonindependence of taxa. Phylogenetic nonindependence arises from homology, the similarity of taxa due to shared ancestry, and treating related taxa as independent data violates assumptions of statistics. Given that an explicit goal of meta‐analysis is to generalize research across a broad range of taxa, then phylogenetic nonindependence may threaten conclusions drawn from such reviews. Here I outline a statistical framework that integrates phylogenetic information into conventional meta‐analysis when (a) taking a weighted average of effect sizes using fixed‐ and random‐effects models and (b) testing for homogeneity of variances. I also outline how to test evolutionary hypotheses with meta‐analysis by describing a method that evaluates phylogenetic conservatism and a model‐selection framework that competes neutral and adaptive hypotheses to explain variation in meta‐analytical data. Finally, I address several theoretical and practical issues relating to the application and availability of phylogenetic information for meta‐analysis.},

New sequencing technologies provide great potential for investigating natural selection in plants using population genomic approaches. However, plant populations frequently show significant departures from the assumptions of standard models used to detect selection and many forms of directional selection do not fit with classical population genetics theory. Here, we explore the extent to which plant populations show departures from standard model assumptions, and the implications this has for detecting selection on molecular variation. A growing number of multilocus studies of nucleotide variation suggest that changes in population size, particularly bottlenecks, and strong subdivision may be common in plants. This demographic variation presents important challenges for models used to infer selection. In addition, selection from standing genetic variation and multiple independent adaptive substitutions can further complicate efforts to understand the nature of selection. We discuss emerging patterns from plant studies and propose that, rather than treating population history as a nuisance variable when testing for selection, the interaction between demography and selection is of fundamental importance for evolutionary studies of plant populations using molecular data.},

Beetles clearly preferred shaved disks to unshaved ones taken from the same leaf; this preference was highest in leaves of the most pubescent plants. High leaf pubescence explained the low preference for willow clones from the high density site in among-site preference trials; shaving significantly increased the consumption of these pubescent willow clones. In no-choice experiments, the food consumption by both adults and last instar larvae decreased with an increase in leaf pubescence. The time budget of adults did not depend on leaf pubescence of the host plants, however adults compelled to feed on highly pubescent plants changed their feeding sites twice as often as on less pubescent willow clones. Larvae feeding on highly pubescent plants spend moving three times as much time as larvae feeding on less pubescent plants. Combined with our earlier observations on the increase in leaf pubescence in the year(s) following defoliation, these data suggest that leaf hairiness may have contributed to the delayed induced resistance in S. borealis by disturbing the feeding behaviour of M. lapponica.},

We quantified interactions of four annual grassland species in two-species mixtures at varying frequencies. We found evidence of strong negative frequency-dependent stabilization, where scaled population growth rates increased with decreasing frequency for all four species. There was also a consistent competitive hierarchy among these species indicative of strong fitness differences that, in most cases, suggested potential competitive exclusion despite the observed strong stabilization.},

If the conditions are met, an analysis of the stationary conditions when the phenotypes have equal fitnesses permits quantitative statements about the outcome of selection without recourse to genetic models. Phenotypic analyses of natural selection are illustrated by models of sex ratios in plants, sexual versus asexual reproduction in plants, and parental investment by animals.},

Common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) is an annual weed native to North America and has been introduced to Europe where it has become invasive. Using a custom-designed NimbleGen oligoarray, we examined differences in gene expression between five native and six introduced populations of common ragweed in three different environments (control, light stress and nutrient stress), as well as two different time points. We identified candidate genes that may contribute to invasiveness in common ragweed based on differences in expression between native and introduced populations from Europe. Specifically, we found 180 genes where range explained a significant proportion of the variation in gene expression and a further 103 genes with a significant range by treatment interaction. Several of these genes are potentially involved in the metabolism of secondary compounds, stress response and the detoxification of xenobiotics. Previously, we found more rapid growth and greater reproductive success in introduced populations, particularly in benign and competitive (light stress) environments, and many of these candidate genes potentially underlie these growth differences. We also found expression differences among populations within each range, reflecting either local adaptation or neutral processes, although no associations with climate or latitude were identified. These data provide a first step in identifying genes that are involved with introduction success in an aggressive annual weed.},

	abstract = {The population dynamics of a one-predator-two-prey system were modeled. This model included the evolution of antipredator defense in the prey species and the optimal diet choice in the predator and was analyzed numerically using computer simulations. Results showed that defense evolution in the prey species tended to promote coexistence of the three species and, depending on parameters, reduced the amplitude of density fluctuations. Introducing optimal diet choice by the predator into the model also promoted coexistence and generally reduced density fluctuations. When the additive genetic variance for defense intensity was large (i.e., the evolutionary rate of defense was rapid), coexistence of the three species and stabilization of dynamics tended to be promoted. As a consequence, we concluded that (1) the evolution of antipredator defense can be an important factor in the persistence of a community, either with or without the optimal diet choice of predator; and (2) when population dynamics are combined with the evolutionary dynamics of trait development, the relative time scale of the two processes plays an important role in the stability of the system.},

Castanopsis (Fagaceae) is one of the dominant tree species in the broadleaved evergreen forests of Japan. In this study we investigate the genetic diversity, genetic structure and leaf epidermal morphology of 63 natural populations of C. sieboldii and C. cuspidata, using 32 Expressed Sequence Tag associated microsatellites. The overall genetic differentiation between populations was low (GST = 0.069 in C. sieboldii and GST = 0.057 in C. cuspidata). Neighbor-joining tree and Bayesian clustering analyses revealed that the populations of C. sieboldii and C. cuspidata were genetically clearly differentiated, a result which is consistent with the morphology of their epidermal cell layers. This suggests that C. sieboldii and C. cuspidata should be treated as independent species, although intermediate morphologies are often observed, especially at sites where the two species coexist. The higher level of genetic diversity observed in the Kyushu region (for both species) and the Ryukyu Islands (for C. sieboldii) is consistent with the available fossil pollen data for Castanopsis-type broadleaved evergreen trees during the Last Glacial Maximum and suggests the existence of refugia for Castanopsis forests in southern Japan. Within the C. sieboldii populations, Bayesian clustering analyses detected three clusters, in the western and eastern parts of the main islands and in the Ryukyu Islands. The west-east genetic differentiation observed for this species in the main islands, a pattern which is also found in several plant and animal species inhabiting Castanopsis forests in Japan, suggests that they have been isolated from each other in the western and eastern populations for an extended period of time, and may imply the existence of eastern refugia.},

The need to understand coevolution as an ongoing process has grown as ecological concerns have risen over the dynamics of rapidly changing biological communities, the conservation of genetic diversity, and the population biology of diseases. The biggest current challenge is to understand how coevolution operates across broad geographic landscapes, linking local ecological processes with phylogeographic patterns. The geographic mosaic theory of coevolution provides a framework for asking how coevolution continually reshapes interactions across different spatial and temporal scales. It produces specific hypotheses on how geographically structured coevolution differs from coevolution at the local scale. It also provides a framework for understanding how local maladaptation can result from coevolution and why coevolved interactions may rarely produce long lists of coevolved traits that become fixed within species. Long‐term field studies of the same interaction across multiple communities and spatially structured mathematical models are together beginning to show that coevolution may be a more important ongoing process than had been indicated by earlier empirical and theoretical studies lacking a geographic perspective.},

	abstract = {• Background and Aims The Laperrine's olive (Olea europaea subsp. laperrinei) is an endemic tree from Saharan massifs. Its populations have substantially regressed since the Pleistocene and are presently distributed in a fragmented habitat. Long-term persistence of this taxon is uncertain and programmes of preservation have to be urgently implemented. To define a conservation strategy, the genetic diversity and breeding system of this tree have to be investigated. • Methods One hundred and eleven ramets were prospected in the laperrinei populations from the Tamanrasset region, southern Algeria. Genetic polymorphism was revealed at nuclear and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) microsatellite loci allowing a comparative assessment of the genetic diversity of laperrinei and Mediterranean populations based on bi-parental and maternal markers. Additionally, nuclear microsatellite markers enabled the genotypes to be identified unambiguously. • Key Results Based on nuclear microsatellite data, the total diversity was high (Ht = 0·61) in laperrinei populations and similar to that observed in western Mediterranean populations. A substantial cpDNA diversity (Ht = 0·19) was also observed. Genetically identical ramets originated from the same stump (which can cover {\textbackslash}textgreater80 m2) were identified in each population. Sixteen per cent of genets exhibited more than one ramet. In addition, several cases of somatic mutations were unambiguously revealed in distinct ramets stemming from the same stump. • Conclusions These data show that highly isolated and small laperrinei populations are able to maintain a high genetic diversity. This supports the existence of relict trees persisting for a very long time (probably since the last humid transition, 3000 years ago). It is proposed that the very long persistence associated with an asexual multiplication of highly adapted trees could be a strategy of survival in extreme conditions avoiding a mutational meltdown due to reproduction in reduced populations.},

	abstract = {We consider the role that key structural traits, such as spinescence, pubescence, sclerophylly and raphides, play in protecting plants from herbivore attack. Despite the likelihood that many of these morphological characteristics may have evolved as responses to other environmental stimuli, we show that each provides an important defence against herbivore attack in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. We conclude that leaf-mass–area is a robust index of sclerophylly as a surrogate for more rigorous mechanical properties used in herbivory studies. We also examine herbivore counter-adaptations to plant structural defence and illustrate how herbivore attack can induce the deployment of intensified defensive measures. Although there have been few studies detailing how plant defences vary with age, we show that allocation to structural defences is related to plant ontogeny. Age-related changes in the deployment of structural defences plus a paucity of appropriate studies are two reasons why relationships with other plant fitness characteristics may be obscured, although we describe studies where trade-offs between structural defence and plant growth, reproduction, and chemical defences have been demonstrated. We also show how resource availability influences the expression of structural defences and demonstrate how poorly our understanding of plant structural defence fits into contemporary plant defence theory. Finally, we suggest how a better understanding of plant structural defence, particularly within the context of plant defence syndromes, would not only improve our understanding of plant defence theory, but enable us to predict how plant morphological responses to climate change might influence interactions at the individual (plant growth trade-offs), species (competition), and ecosystem (pollination and herbivory) levels.},

These patterns are fashioned both by inflicted physical damage as well as by biological components displayed or released by the attacker. Different types of attacking organisms might therefore be expected to elicit different transcription programs in the host. Using a large-scale DNA microarray, we characterized gene expression in damaged as well as in distal Arabidopsis thaliana leaves in response to the specialist insect, Pieris rapae. More than 100 insect-responsive genes potentially involved in defense were identified, including genes involved in pathogenesis, indole glucosinolate metabolism, detoxification and cell survival, and signal transduction. Of these 114 genes, 111 were induced in Pieris feeding, and only three were repressed. Expression patterns in distal leaves were markedly similar to those of local leaves. Analysis of wild-type and jasmonate mutant plants, coupled with jasmonate treatment, showed that between 67 and 84\% of Pieris-regulated gene expression was controlled, totally or in part, by the jasmonate pathway. This was correlated with increased larval performance on the coronatine insensitive1 glabrous1 (coi1-1 gl1) mutant. Independent mutations in COI1 and GL1 led to a faster larval weight gain, but the gl1 mutation had relatively little effect on the expression of the insect-responsive genes examined. Finally, we compared transcript patterns in Arabidopis in response to larvae of the specialist P. rapae and to a generalist insect, Spodoptera littoralis. Surprisingly, given the complex nature of insect salivary components and reported differences between species, almost identical transcript profiles were observed. This study also provides a robustly characterized gene set for the further investigation of plant–insect interaction.},

We evaluate whether current management practices, which consist mainly of summer grazing by livestock, are sufficient to maintain plant species composition in a stable state across semi-natural areas in Denmark, or if shifts in functional composition are taking place. Further, we investigate important drivers of any ongoing changes through trait differences between winner and loser species. * Using a data set of 6513 annually inventoried (2004–2010) vegetation plots from 202 semi-natural NATURA 2000 protected areas, we assessed changes in cover of all plant species and, using boosted regression trees, whether winners and losers differ in regard to autecological characteristics and traits. * There were consistent changes in cover for 123 out of 603 species across the 6-year study period, with more species losing than winning (78 vs. 45). Winner and loser species were strongly differentiated by competition-related traits, but traits related to soil nutrients and soil moisture also had some importance. Generally, our results indicate a trend towards taller and more competitive species. * Synthesis and applications. Despite conservation actions in order to maintain a so-called favourable conservation status, vegetation in NATURA 2000 protected areas is still undergoing compositional changes. Overall, autecological characteristics and trait differences between winners and losers match expectations given the contemporary anthropogenic pressures, especially reduced livestock grazing. Atmospheric nitrogen deposition and increased soil moisture due to reduced drainage might also be involved in observed changes. Current management (i.e. summer grazing by livestock) is insufficient to preserve the diversity of less-competitive, low-statured and stress-tolerant herbaceous species, potentially leading to species losses. Such patterns can thus be expected across semi-natural ecosystems in north-western Europe and other places where traditional land use (i.e. previous widespread extensive livestock grazing) have been replaced with various degrees of conservation management. A greater focus on returning large grazing herbivores to conservation areas is recommended for the protection of plant species diversity and to counteract ongoing changes.},

	abstract = {Local adaptation is of fundamental importance in evolutionary, population, conservation, and global-change biology. The generality of local adaptation in plants and whether and how it is influenced by specific species, population and habitat characteristics have, however, not been quantitatively reviewed. Therefore, we examined published data on the outcomes of reciprocal transplant experiments using two approaches. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the performance of local and foreign plants at all transplant sites. In addition, we analysed frequencies of pairs of plant origin to examine whether local plants perform better than foreign plants at both compared transplant sites. In both approaches, we also examined the effects of population size, and of the habitat and species characteristics that are predicted to affect local adaptation. We show that, overall, local plants performed significantly better than foreign plants at their site of origin: this was found to be the case in 71.0\% of the studied sites. However, local plants performed better than foreign plants at both sites of a pair-wise comparison (strict definition of local adaption) only in 45.3\% of the 1032 compared population pairs. Furthermore, we found local adaptation much more common for large plant populations ({\textbackslash}textgreater1000 flowering individuals) than for small populations ({\textbackslash}textless1000 flowering individuals) for which local adaptation was very rare. The degree of local adaptation was independent of plant life history, spatial or temporal habitat heterogeneity, and geographic scale. Our results suggest that local adaptation is less common in plant populations than generally assumed. Moreover, our findings reinforce the fundamental importance of population size for evolutionary theory. The clear role of population size for the ability to evolve local adaptation raises considerable doubt on the ability of small plant populations to cope with changing environments.},

We studied the effects of plant genotypic diversity of tall goldenrod Solidago altissima on the population dynamics of the aphid Uroleucon nigrotuberculatum. We found genotypic variation in plant resistance to the aphid in our experiments. To determine the impact of plant genotypic diversity on aphid population dynamics, we compared aphid densities under conditions of three treatments: single-genotype plots, mixed-genotype plots and mixed-genotype-with-cages plots. In the latter treatment plants were individually caged to prevent natural enemy attack and aphid movement among plants. The synergistic effects of genotypes on population size were demonstrated by the greater aphid population size in the mixed-genotype treatment than expected from additive effects alone. Two non-exclusive hypotheses are proposed to explain this pattern. First, there is a source–sink relationship among plant genotypes: aphids move from plant genotypes where their reproduction is high to genotypes where their reproduction is low. Second, natural enemy mortality is reduced in mixed plots in a matrix of diverse plant genotypes.},

	abstract = {Many invasive species can respond opportunistically to favorable growing conditions. In a previous work, we found that invasive species in the family Commelinaceae were more opportunistic than their noninvasive congeners and could therefore outperform noninvasive relatives in an environment with abundant resources and no competition. Contrary to the expectation that superior performance under favorable conditions comes at the cost of reduced performance under stressful conditions, invasive species did not perform more poorly relative to noninvasive congeners under any conditions we examined. Here we expand our search for potential costs of opportunism in invasive species to additional environmental conditions in which invasive taxa have been shown or predicted to perform poorly. We grew four invasive and four noninvasive species in environments consisting of all possible combinations of high and low soil resources and presence and absence of clipping (removal of aboveground biomass). We also fed leaves of each species to a generalist herbivore to assess resistance to herbivory. We found that the advantage of invasive species is reduced but not eliminated by low soil resources and clipping. At low soil resources, invasive species produced softer leaves than noninvasive species and might therefore be less resistant to generalist herbivory than noninvasive species, although a direct comparison of resistance in a no-choice bioassay revealed no difference. The invasive species outperformed noninvasive species only under the most favorable conditions, and the noninvasive species did not outperform the invasive species in any environment.},

	abstract = {Different biological parameters of the stink bugs, Nezara viridula L. and Piezodorus guildinii Westwood (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), are affected by the developmental stage of the soybean (Glycine max Merrill) pods they feed on. These effects of the soybean on the stink bugs could represent a selection pressure leading to the ability of these species to discriminate the phenological stage of soybean pods, and, therefore, to exhibit feeding preferences. We designed three studies: (1) Distant detection of soybean pods through an olfactometer; (2) Free choice tests to evaluate preferences for soybean pods of different developmental stages; (3) No choice tests to study effects of soybean pod development on feeding time and number of probes. Stink bugs showed no differential response to olfactometer arms with or without soybean pods, suggesting an inability to detect soybean volatiles. Free choice tests showed no species effects on pods selection, but significant differences among fifth instar nymphs, adult male, and adult females. Fifth instar nymphs fed more frequently on soybean pods of advanced development stages compared to female adults, despite previous evidence showing poor development of stink bugs fed pods of the same stage. No choice tests showed significant effects of stink bug species, stink bug stage and sex, and soybean pod phenology. N. viridula expressed shorter feeding times and higher numbers of probes than P. guildinii. The highest numbers of probes of both species were observed when they were fed soybean pods in early phenological stages. When placed in direct contact with food, fifth instar nymphs prefered to feed on more developed pods, despite these pods being suboptimal food items. These results suggest that for the ecological time framework of soybean-stink bugs coexistence, around thirty-five years in Argentina, the selection pressure was not enough for stink bugs to evolve food preferences that match their performance on soybean pods of different development stages.},

Although 11 plant species, all in the family Verbenaceae, supported complete development of Longitarsus sp. during no-choice tests, the beetles showed very strong preferences for L. camara during paired-choice and multi-choice tests. The results confirm that the beetles have a narrow host range, and that under natural conditions they are highly unlikely to utilise plants other than L. camara. In the unlikely event that some of the Lippia spp. are attacked in the field, they are not expected to sustain populations of the flea beetle over time. Attributes that should enhance the biocontrol potential of Longitarsus sp. include: the adults are long-lived and highly mobile; and, the larvae cause extensive direct damage to the roots of L. camara, which could in turn expose the plants to soil-born pathogens. All indications are that Longitarsus sp. could make a substantial contribution to the biological control of L. camara in many countries around the world because the beetles pose no threat to non-target plant species and they damage a part of the plant (i.e. roots) not yet affected by any other agent species.},

The general expectation has been that arms races predominate in cases of polygenic inheritance of resistance traits and permanent cycling predominates in cases in which resistance is controlled by major genes. In the interaction between Depressaria pastinacella, the parsnip webworm, and Pastinaca sativa, the wild parsnip, traits for plant resistance to insect herbivory (production of defensive furanocoumarins) as well as traits for herbivore “virulence” (ability to metabolize furanocoumarins) are characterized by continuous heritable variation. Furanocoumarin production in plants and rates of metabolism in insects were compared among four midwestern populations; these traits then were classified into four clusters describing multitrait phenotypes occurring in all or most of the populations. When the frequency of plant phenotypes belonging to each of the clusters is compared with the frequency of the insect phenotypes in each of the clusters across populations, a remarkable degree of frequency matching is revealed in three of the populations. That frequencies of phenotypes vary among populations is consistent with the fact that spatial variation occurs in the temporal cycling of phenotypes; such processes contribute in generating a geographic mosaic in this coevolutionary interaction on the landscape scale. Comparisons of contemporary plant phenotype distributions with phenotypes of herbarium specimens collected 9–125 years ago from across a similar latitudinal gradient, however, suggest that for at least one resistance trait—sphondin concentration—interactions with webworms have led to escalatory change.},

Foraging decisions by herbivores depend on variation in food types, the scale(s) at which this variation occurs and the opportunity and capacity for herbivores to respond to such variation. These decisions affect not only the herbivores themselves, but also the vulnerability of individual plants to being eaten. Associational plant refuges, in which neighbouring plants alter focal plant vulnerability, are an emergent property of foraging decisions.2. Using the red-bellied pademelon (Thylogale billardierii) as a model generalist mammalian herbivore, we investigated the spatial scale(s) at which animals made foraging decisions and the resultant effect on focal plant vulnerability. In a replicated design, we varied vegetation at the individual plant scale, generating intraspecific differences in Eucalyptus nitens seedlings by altering their nutrient status (high, low). We varied vegetation at the patch scale, in which seedlings were planted, using high- (grass) and low- (herbicided) quality patches. Animals were allowed to choose where they fed and what they ate. Animal behaviour was recorded and intake of seedlings measured.3. We found that animals made foraging decisions first at the patch scale then at the scale of individual plants; both patch and focal seedling characteristics influenced browsing. Pademelons spent most of their time in high-quality patches, and seedlings were consequently more vulnerable there than in low-quality patches. Pademelons also ate more foliage from high- than from low-nutrient status seedlings. This behaviour concentrated resources, increasing foraging efficiency and making focal plants more vulnerable to browsing.4. The opportunity and capacity to choose at both plant and patch scales resulted in a pattern of focal plant vulnerability consistent with the repellent-plant hypothesis. This contrasts with our previous study, in which animals were only provided with choice at the plant level and plant vulnerability followed the attractant-decoy hypothesis. These combined results demonstrate that the influence of neighbouring vegetation on consumption of a focal plant depends on the spatial scale of selection and on opportunities (and capacity) for herbivores to choose.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary genetics of invasive species has been relatively unexplored, but could offer insights into mechanisms of invasions. Recent studies suggest that the invasion success of many species might depend more heavily on their ability to respond to natural selection than on broad physiological tolerance or plasticity. Thus, these studies stress the importance of genetic architecture, selection upon which could result in evolutionary adaptations and possibly speciation. For instance, epistatic interactions and the action of a few genes could facilitate invasion success. These findings emphasize the utility of genomic approaches for determining invasion mechanisms, through analysis of gene expression, gene interactions, and genomic rearrangements that are associated with invasion events.},

One of these research communities investigates how plants utilize secondary metabolites or defense metabolites to defend against attack by pathogens and other biotic organisms. This use of systems biology to integrate across transcriptomics, metabolomics, and genomics is significantly enhancing the rate of discovery of genes, metabolites, and bioactivities for plant defense compounds as well as extending our knowledge of how these compounds are regulated. Plant defense compounds are also providing a unique proving platform to develop new approaches that enhance the ability to conduct systems biology with existing and previously unforseen genomics data sets.

	abstract = {To examine the mediation of host-predator interaction by a parasite, we studied the three-level interactions among a host plant, a root hemiparasitic plant, and their common predator, a generalist snail herbivore. The host species, Trifolium repens, is able to synthesize cyanogenic glucosides that have a significant role in plant herbivore resistance. Some T. repens populations are polymorphic with respect to cyanogenesis. Our second aim was to examine whether the mediation of the host plant-herbivore interaction by the parasitic plant could affect the maintenance of the cyanogenic polymorphism. The parasitic plant (Rhinanthus serotinus) was equally harmful to cyanogenic and acyanogenic hosts and grew equally well on both host types. In a no-choice experiment, both cyanogenesis and root hemiparasitism of the host plant reduced the growth of the herbivore (Arianta arbustorum). The herbivores consumed less leaf area of the parasitized plants than of unparasitized plants, but only when the host plant was acyanogenic. In a multiple-choice experiment, the snails were similarly affected by cyanogenesis but not by parasitic infection of the host. Thus, there was a discrepancy between food choice and performance of the herbivore. Our results suggest that the overall effects of the parasitic plant on the host plant were ameliorated through the indirect effects of the parasitic infection on herbivore performance and food consumption. This indirect effect of the parasitic infection seemed to be more beneficial for the acyanogenic plants: if parasitized, the leaf area of acyanogenic plants consumed by the herbivore was 45\% higher than that of cyanogenic plants, whereas in unparasitized plants the corresponding figure was 114\%. Thus, parasitism may decrease the advantage cyanogenic plants gain through decreased herbivory. Further, in mainly cyanogenic T. repens populations, cyanogenesis might be a more important feeding deterrent than root parasitism; whereas in mainly acyanogenic populations root parasitism might be relevant to herbivore-T. repens interactions. We are the first to document the effects of a plant parasite on the performance of both the host plant and a host-feeding herbivore. Our results highlight the need to look beyond the direct effect of parasites on their hosts.},

However, evidence for the role of structural traits in influencing herbivore food choice and performance has come from correlative studies, whereas the underlying mechanisms have been given little attention. By manipulating the biomechanical properties of a host grass species through a combination of lyophilization and milling, and providing water separately, we were able to compare behavioral, physiological, and developmental responses of the Australian plague locust, Chortoicetes terminifera, to the biomechanical properties of plant food (exemplified by toughness) independently of the food's macronutrient content and the insect's demand for water. Increasing leaf toughness was associated with reduced rates of locust growth and prolonged development, with potential ecological consequences. Poorer performance on the tougher foods was primarily a consequence of a reduced rate of nutrient supply, which occurred as a result of (1) smaller meals being eaten more slowly, (2) slowed gut passage rates, which limited how quickly the next meal could be taken, and (3) reduced efficiency of assimilation of nutrients from food in the gut. In addition, there were deleterious changes in the ratio of protein to carbohydrate assimilated from the gut. Prolonged development time was associated with increased total nutrient demands throughout the extended developmental period. Because these demands could not be met by increased consumption, there was a decreased efficiency of conversion of assimilated nutrients to growth. By disentangling the effects of biomechanical properties from macronutrient and water content we have shown that leaf biomechanical traits can influence chewing herbivores independently of leaf chemical traits.},

Populations of well-defended prey may therefore be vulnerable to invasion from rare ‘cheater’ mutants that do not produce the toxin themselves but obtain some protection from their resemblance to their better defended conspecifics (automimicry). Although it is well established that well-defended and weakly defended morphs may coexist stably in protected dimorphisms, recent theoretical work suggests that such dimorphisms would not be resistant to invasion by novel mutants with defence levels intermediate to those present. Given that most defences (including toxins) are likely to be continuous traits, this implies that automimicry may tend to be a transitory phenomenon, and thus less likely to explain variation in defence levels in nature. In contrast to this, we show that automimicry can also be evolutionarily stable for continuous traits, and that it may evolve under a wide range of conditions. A recently developed geometric method allows us to determine directly from a trade-off curve whether an evolutionarily stable defence dimorphism is at all possible, and to make some qualitative inferences about the ecological conditions that may favour it.},

	abstract = {SummaryBackground Soil surrounding selenium (Se) hyperaccumulator plants was shown earlier to be enriched in Se, impairing the growth of Se-sensitive plant species. Because Se levels in neighbors of hyperaccumulators were higher and Se has been shown to protect plants from herbivory, we investigate here the potential facilitating effect of Se hyperaccumulators on Se-tolerant neighboring species in the field. Results We measured growth and herbivory of Artemisia ludoviciana and Symphyotrichum ericoides as a function of their Se concentration and proximity to hyperaccumulators Astragalus bisulcatus and Stanleya pinnata. When growing next to hyperaccumulators, A. ludoviciana and S. ericoides contained 10- to 20-fold higher Se levels (800–2,000 mg kg−1 DW) than when growing next to nonaccumulators. The roots of both species were predominantly (70\%–90\%) directed toward hyperaccumulator neighbors, not toward other neighbors. Moreover, neighbors of hyperaccumulators were 2-fold bigger, showed 2-fold less herbivory damage, and harbored 3- to 4-fold fewer arthropods. When used in laboratory choice and nonchoice grasshopper herbivory experiments, Se-rich neighbors of hyperaccumulators experienced less herbivory and caused higher grasshopper Se accumulation (10-fold) and mortality (4-fold). Conclusions Enhanced soil Se levels around hyperaccumulators can facilitate growth of Se-tolerant plant species through reduced herbivory and enhanced growth. This study is the first to show facilitation via enrichment with a nonessential element. It is interesting that Se enrichment of hyperaccumulator neighbors may affect competition in two ways, by reducing growth of Se-sensitive neighbors while facilitating Se-tolerant neighbors. Via these competitive and facilitating effects, Se hyperaccumulators may affect plant community composition and, consequently, higher trophic levels.},

	abstract = {Apparent competition arises when two victim species negatively affect each other (−, −) by enhancing the equilibrium density or changing the foraging behaviour of a shared natural enemy. Shared enemies can also mediate non-reciprocal (−, 0) indirect effects, i.e. indirect amensalism, whenever one prey species is not affected by the presence of alternative prey. We review 34 studies on terrestrial and freshwater systems to evaluate the extent to which apparent competition has been perceived as a reciprocal (−, −) or non-reciprocal (−, 0) interaction. We found only three studies showing reciprocal effects between apparent competitors. Indirect amensalism was documented in 10 studies and could be inferred for 16 other cases (76\% in total). The remaining five studies provided insufficient data to determine the form of indirect interaction. The apparent prevalence of non-reciprocal enemy-mediated interactions resembles that observed for resource-based interspecific competition. Amensal indirect effects via shared predation may result from differences in population size, nutritional value, susceptibility to attack, or asynchronous dynamics of alternative prey, or the predator's feeding preferences. Moreover, experimental protocols may confound the actual form of apparent competition through short-term observations, incomplete designs, or biased consideration of conspicuous interactions, leading to reciprocal effects being overlooked. We conclude that, at present, it is still difficult to determine the relative role of apparent competition vs indirect amensalism in natural food webs because most published studies have failed to document in full interactions via shared enemies.},

Its invasion transforms unvegetated intertidal mudflats to grass-covered marshes, eliminating habitat for birds, fish, and native and cultivated shellfish that depend on the open mudflats. The delphacid planthopper Prokelisia marginata was recently introduced into Willapa Bay, Washington for biological control of this grass. Prior to its introduction, we demonstrated the narrow host range of P. marginata with no-choice tests in the greenhouse using 23 potential species of nontarget plants, including species of native and otherwise valuable grasses and cranberry, Vaccinium marcrocarpon. P. marginata was capable of completing its life cycle only on S. alterniflora, S. anglica (also a noxious weed in Washington State), and S. foliosa (California cordgrass, native southward from San Francisco). Based on these results, we found no evidence of risk to nontarget plants in Washington State from P. marginata. The first release of P. marginata was made in Willapa Bay in August 2000, and the planthopper survived the winter at all three sites. Following additional releases in early summer of 2001 of 65,000 individuals at each site, population densities increased an average of 4.34±1.71-fold in one generation. The populations had spread 200 m from the release area by October, 2001. Macropterous (long-winged) individuals were more common (69\%) within 5 m of the release center, while brachypters (reduced-winged) were more frequent (71\%) at distances greater than 5 m from the release area. In field cages, P. marginata reduced S. alterniflora biomass by 50\% and plant height by 15\% in comparison to planthopper-free controls. These results represented short-term impacts at a localized scale. The ultimate success of this biocontrol program over wider spatial scales will only become known over a longer time period.},

Using a meta-analytical approach, we assessed the biological responses of marine organisms to the effects of ocean acidification and warming in isolation and combination. As expected biological responses varied across taxonomic groups, life-history stages, and trophic levels, but importantly, combining stressors generally exhibited a stronger biological (either positive or negative) effect. Using a subset of orthogonal studies, we show that four of five of the biological responses measured (calcification, photosynthesis, reproduction, and survival, but not growth) interacted synergistically when warming and acidification were combined. The observed synergisms between interacting stressors suggest that care must be made in making inferences from single-stressor studies. Our findings clearly have implications for the development of adaptive management strategies particularly given that the frequency of stressors interacting in marine systems will be likely to intensify in the future. There is now an urgent need to move toward more robust, holistic, and ecologically realistic climate change experiments that incorporate interactions. Without them accurate predictions about the likely deleterious impacts to marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning over the next century will not be possible.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/590510},
	abstract = {ABSTRACT Although sexual interactions between species (reproductive interference) have been reported from a wide range of animal taxa, their potential for determining species coexistence is often disregarded. Here, we review evidence from laboratory and field studies illustrating that heterospecific sexual interactions are frequently associated with fitness loss and can have severe ecological and evolutionary consequences. We define reproductive interference as any kind of interspecific interaction during the process of mate acquisition that adversely affects the fitness of at least one of the species involved and that is caused by incomplete species recognition. We distinguish seven types of reproductive interference: signal jamming, heterospecific rivalry, misdirected courtship, heterospecific mating attempts, erroneous female choice, heterospecific mating, and hybridization. We then discuss the sex-specific costs of these types and highlight two typical features of reproductive interference: density-dependence and asymmetry. Similar to competition, reproductive interference can lead to displacement of one species (sexual exclusion), spatial, temporal, or habitat segregation, changes in life history parameters, and reproductive character displacement. In many cases, patterns of coexistence might be shaped by reproductive interference rather than by resource competition, as the presence of a few heterospecifics might substantially decrease reproductive success. Therefore, interspecific sexual interactions should receive more attention in ecological research. Reproductive interference has mainly been discussed in the context of invasive species or hybrid zones, whereas its influence on naturally-occurring sympatric species pairs has rarely been addressed. To improve our knowledge of the ecological significance of reproductive interference, findings from laboratory experiments should be validated in the field. Future studies should also focus on ecological mechanisms, such as temporal, spatial, or habitat partitioning, that might enable sexually interacting species to coexist. Reproductive interference also has implications for the management of endangered species, which can be threatened by sexual interactions with invasive or common species. Studies of reproductive interference might even provide new insights for biological pest control.},

We compute protected polymorphism conditions that take the form of harmonic means involving both the frequency- and the mating-dependent parameters. This allows for a direct comparison of the equilibrium properties of the frequency-dependent models with those of the constant models and for an analysis of equilibrium of the general model of constant fertility. We then apply the theory to analyze the maintenance of inversion polymorphisms in Drosophila subobscura and D. pseudoobscura, for which data on empirical fitness component estimates are available in the literature. Regression on fitness estimates obtained at different starting frequencies enables us to implement explicit fitness functions in the models and therefore to perform complete studies of equilibrium and stability for particular sets of data. The results point to frequency dependence of fitness components as the main mechanism responsible for the maintenance of the inversion polymorphisms considered, particularly in relation to heterosis, although we also discuss the contribution of other selection mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The effects of mating, age at mating, the presence or absence of a plant leaf, and the deprivation of a suitable ovipositional substrate during when the first ovipositional bout after mating would normally take place, on the lifetime fecundity and fertility (percentage of fertile eggs laid) of female Epiphyas postvittana were investigated. Mating had a significant effect on lifetime fecundity, with mated females laying 2.5 times more eggs than virgin females. Age at mating had a significant effect on both fecundity and fertility, both declining with increasing age when the female was mated. In the presence of a leaf of C. japonica, mated females had a greater lifetime fecundity than when no leaf was present; females in the presence of a C. japonica leaf consistently laid more eggs each day during the first 4–6 days after mating than females without a leaf. When females were deprived of a suitable ovipositional substrate, for the first 22 h after mating, they were significantly less fecund over their lifetime than were control females. Finally, in no-choice tests with three plants of different acceptability to females, the fecundity of females differed in the order C. japonica {\textbackslash}textgreater Urtica ferox {\textbackslash}textgreater Tibouchina multiflora. This different fecundity appeared to be inversely related to the pubescence of the leaves, suggesting that leaf texture may be a suitable antixenotic resistance factor for crops to be protected from this insect. These results suggest that strategies whereby mating is delayed or oviposition reduced within a critical period after mating, may result in significant reductions in pest populations.},

	abstract = {To examine how genetic variation in a plant population affects arthropod community richness and composition, we quantified the arthropod communities on a synthetic population of Eucalyptus amygdalina, E. risdonii, and their F1 and advanced-generation hybrids. Five major patterns emerged. First, the pure species and hybrid populations supported significantly different communities. Second, species richness was significantly greatest on hybrids (F1 {\textbackslash}textgreater F2 {\textbackslash}textgreater E. amygdalina {\textbackslash}textgreater E. risdonii). These results are similar to those from a wild population of the same species and represent the first case in which both synthetic and wild population studies confirm a genetic component to community structure. Hybrids also acted as centers of biodiversity by accumulating both the common and specialist taxa of both parental species (100\% in the wild and 80\% in the synthetic population). Third, species richness was significantly greater on F1s than the single F2 family, suggesting that the increased insect abundance on hybrids may not be caused by the breakup of coadapted gene complexes. Fourth, specialist arthropod taxa were most likely to show a dominance response to F1 hybrids, whereas generalist taxa exhibited a susceptible response. Fifth, in an analysis of 31 leaf terpenoids that are thought to play a role in plant defense, hybrids were generally intermediate to the parental chemotypes. Within the single F2 family, we found significant associations between the communities of individual trees and five individual oil components, including oil yield, demonstrating that there is a genetic effect on plant defensive chemistry that, in turn, may affect community structure. These studies argue that hybridization has important community-level consequences and that the genetic variation present in hybrid zones can be used to explore the genetic-based mechanisms that structure communities.},

Eighty-one plants of 18 populations of 6 species (P. gloriosa, P. iwatensis, P. nipponica, P. ochiaiana, P. sceptrum-carolinum and P. grandiflora) were analyzed. Fifteen distinct haplotypes were identified based on six cpDNA regions: the intergenic spacer between the trnT and trnL 3′exon, trnL 3′exon-trnF, atpB-rbcL, accD–psaI, the rpl16 intron and the trnK region (including the matK gene). Via phylogenetic analyses of the haplotypes, two continental species, P. sceptrum-carolinum and P. grandiflora, were placed at the most ancestral position in the trees. The former species is widely distributed in the Eurasian continent, and the latter is distributed in Far East Asia. Two robust major cpDNA clades (clades I and II) were revealed in the Japanese archipelago, although the statistical values of monophyly of these clades were weak. Clade I included the haplotypes (A-1, A-2, B-1, B-2 and J) of three species (P. gloriosa, P. iwatensis and P. ochiaiana), and Clade II included seven haplotypes (C-D, E-1, E-2 and F-H) of P. nipponica. These results suggest that this series originated on the Eurasian continent and that subsequently populations at the eastern edge of the continent differentiated into the two Japanese lineages.},

	abstract = {Aphids have long been considered ‘stealthy’ herbivores that subvert a plant's induced defenses and manipulate its source-sink signaling, but these hypotheses are largely untested at a transcriptional level. We analysed gene expression in native tobacco plants (Nicotiana attenuata) infested with Myzus nicotianae aphids, without resorting to the use of clip-cages, with a cDNA microarray containing 240 defense-related N. attenuata genes. Using a hybridization scheme (‘ratio analysis’ and ‘state analysis’) broadly applicable in two-factor analyses, we examined how the aphids influenced source–sink relationships and determined if their feeding preference, apart from benefiting from the sink strength of young leaves, was associated with the expression of known plant defense genes. In contrast to the responses elicited by attack from tissue-feeding lepidopteran larvae and mesophyll-sucking insects, attack from phloem-feeding aphids elicited only weak responses. Similar to other herbivores, M. nicotianae feeding increased the expression of trypsin protease inhibitors (TPI), lipoxygenase, and xyloglucan-endotransglycosylase genes, and decreased small RUBISCO subunit and ubiquitin carrier protein transcripts. Aphid-specific changes included the up-regulation of glutamate synthase and the down-regulation of a germin-like protein. Aphids preferentially settled on younger leaves, which expressed more hydroperoxide lyase and TPI than did older leaves, suggesting that these genes, which mediate the synthesis of compounds reported to be toxic for aphids in other plant systems, are either not under transcriptional control or not important in this system. By identifying aphid-responsive genes, we have made a first step in identifying the ‘genes that matter’ in plant–aphid interactions.},

Here, we investigate the relative influences of historical and contemporary gene flow and drift on the population genetic structure of Kirengeshoma palmata, a perennial herb from East China and South Japan. • Methods: We used data from nine polymorphic microsatellite loci to assess the levels of genetic diversity, effective population size, and contemporary and historical gene flow for six of the seven known populations. • Key results: We found high levels of inbreeding and allelic diversity within populations. Both contemporary and historical migration rates among populations were low, and a test of alternate models of population history strongly favored a model of long-term drift–migration equilibrium. We inferred declines in population size ca. 10 000–100 000 yr ago, but failed to detect recent declines. Bayesian clustering divided K. palmata populations into three genetic clusters, two of which were consistent with a glacial refugium hypothesis for two mountain ranges in East China. • Conclusions: These results suggest that anthropogenic fragmentation has had little effect on the genetic characteristics of Chinese K. palmata. Rather, past decline in population size due to Late Pleistocene climate change as well as restricted pollen and seed dispersal may have contributed to low levels of both historical and contemporary gene flow, resulting in high genetic differentiation between adjacent mountain ranges due to genetic drift and inbreeding.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/2408649},
	abstract = {Studies of spatial variation in the environment have primarily focused on how genetic variation can be maintained. Many one-locus genetic models have addressed this issue, but, for several reasons, these models are not directly applicable to quantitative (polygenic) traits. One reason is that for continuously varying characters, the evolution of the mean phenotype expressed in different environments (the norm of reaction) is also of interest. Our quantitative genetic models describe the evolution of phenotypic response to the environment, also known as phenotypic plasticity (Gause, 1947), and illustrate how the norm of reaction (Schmalhausen, 1949) can be shaped by selection. These models utilize the statistical relationship which exists between genotype-environment interaction and genetic correlation to describe evolution of the mean phenotype under soft and hard selection in coarse-grained environments. Just as genetic correlations among characters within a single environment can constrain the response to simultaneous selection, so can a genetic correlation between states of a character which are expressed in two environments. Unless the genetic correlation across environments is ±1, polygenic variation is exhausted, or there is a cost to plasticity, panmictic populations under a bivariate fitness function will eventually attain the optimum mean phenotype for a given character in each environment. However, very high positive or negative correlations can substantially slow the rate of evolution and may produce temporary maladaptation in one environment before the optimum joint phenotype is finally attained. Evolutionary trajectories under hard and soft selection can differ: in hard selection, the environments with the highest initial mean fitness contribute most individuals to the mating pool. In both hard and soft selection, evolution toward the optimum in a rare environment is much slower than it is in a common one. A subdivided population model reveals that migration restriction can facilitate local adaptation. However, unless there is no migration or one of the special cases discussed for panmictic populations holds, no geographical variation in the norm of reaction will be maintained at equilibrium. Implications of these results for the interpretation of spatial patterns of phenotypic variation in natural populations are discussed.},

F1 hybrids between oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and weedy B. rapa can be significantly more fit than their weedy parents under some conditions; however, under other conditions they are less fit. To understand the reasons, we measured the seed production of B. napus, B. rapa, and different generations of hybrid plants at three different densities and in mixtures of different frequencies (including pure stands). Brassica napus, B. rapa, and backcross plants (F1 ♀ × B. rapa) produced many more seeds per plant in pure plots than in mixtures and more seeds in plots when each was present at high frequency. The opposite was true for F1 plants that produced many more seeds than B. rapa in mixtures, but fewer in pure stands. Both vegetative and reproductive interactions may be responsible for these effects. Our results show that the fitness of both parents and hybrids is strongly frequency-dependent and that the likelihood of introgression of genes between the species thus may depend on the numbers and densities of parents and their various hybrid offspring in the population.},

	abstract = {Within 24 hr. after the application of gibberellic acid (GA) to vegetative plants of biennial Hyoscyamus and of the long-day plant Samolus, a considerable increase in mitotic activity was observed in the pith, cortical, and vascular tissues of the rosette axis immediately below the apical meristem. As the treatment continued, the zone of cell division increased commensurate with the increase in length of the stem; the new cell divisions formed transverse walls predominantly and thus contributed to stem elongation. The cell contribution from the apical meristem was but a small fraction of the total produced by the subapical tissues, suggesting that the induced subapical mitotic activity is the main site of tissue development in the shoot. There was no evidence for cell elongation for at least 72 hr. after application of GA, and, hence, the initial increase in stem length was due solely to an increase in cell number. With regard to the general problem of shoot histogenesis, our data for the rosette plants and those for Xanthium and Chrysanthemum showing extensive cell division far below the apical meristem, are in full agreement with the studies by Bindloss (1942) with tomato, and support her conclusion that "... it is no longer possible to think that the chief center of cell division is in a relatively short zone 60 to 100 microns from the stem tip . . . and that cell division activity in the promeristem is not solely responsible for stem length." On the contrary, the mitotic activity in the subapical regions is undoubtedly responsible for the major part of the cells found in the stem.},

Here, intraspecific variation in herbivore community composition and transcriptional profiles between two Brassica oleracea cultivars grown in the field is addressed. Early in the season, no differences in community composition were found for naturally occurring herbivores, whereas cultivars differed greatly in abundance, species richness, and herbivore community later in the season. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis using an Arabidopsis thaliana oligonucleotide microarray showed clear differences for the expression levels of 26 genes between the two cultivars later in the season. Several defence-related genes showed higher levels of expression in the cultivar that harboured the lowest numbers of herbivores. Our study shows that herbivore community composition develops differentially throughout the season on the two B. oleracea cultivars grown in the field.

Peroxidase induction occurred in inoculated, `local,' symptom-bearing leaves 3 days after inoculation, and in `systemic,' symptom-free leaves on the same plants 1 day later. Phenolics were elevated in systemic but not in local leaves 3 days after inoculation. Detached systemic leaves from plants inoculated with C. cucumerinum developed significantly fewer and smaller lesions after challenge with C. orbiculare. Spotted cucumber beetles did not show consistently significant preferences for infected versus control leaf disks in comparisons using local or systemic leaves, but trends differed significantly between leaf positions. In no-choice tests, beetles removed more leaf area from local but not from systemic infected leaves compared to control leaves, and melon aphid reproduction was enhanced on local infected leaves. In the field, cucumber beetle and melon aphid densities did not differ between infected and control plants. Antipathogenic plant chemical responses did not predict reduced herbivory by insects.

	abstract = {A new hypothesis, based on differences in the rates at which populations of competing species approach competitive equilibrium (reduction or exclusion of some species), is proposed to explain patterns of species diversity. The hypothesis assumes that most communities exist in a state of nonequilibrium where competitive equilibrium is prevented by periodic population reductions and environmental fluctuations. When competitive equilibrium is prevented, a dynamic balance may be established between the rate of competitive displacement and the frequency of population reduction, which results in a stable level of diversity. Under conditions of infrequent reductions, an increase in the population growth rates of competitors generally results in decreased diversity. This model clarifies an underlying pattern of variation in diversity and points out the common elements of previous hypotheses. Rather than arguing that either competition, predation, or productivity control diversity, it demonstrates that all of these may contribute to the same basic mechanism. In doing so, it not only explains the correlations of the other hypotheses with patterns of diversity, but also explains the exceptions that these hypotheses could not explain. This hypothesis may be applied to variations of diversity both on a latitudinal gradient and within specific regions.},

	abstract = {Spatial and temporal variation in insect floral herbivory is common and often important. Yet, the determinants of such variation remain incompletely understood. Using 12 years of flowering data and 4 years of biweekly insect counts, we evaluated four hypotheses to explain variation in damage by the Eurasian flower head weevil, Rhinocyllus conicus, to the native North American wavyleaf thistle, Cirsium undulatum. The four factors hypothesized to influence weevil impact were variations in climate, weevil abundance, phenological synchrony, and number of flower heads available, either on wavyleaf thistle or on the other cooccurring, acquired native host plant (Platte thistle, Cirsium canescens), or on both. Climate did not contribute significantly to an explanation of variation in R. conicus damage to wavyleaf thistle. However, climate did influence weevil synchrony with wavyleaf flower head initiation, and phenological synchrony was important in determining R. conicus oviposition levels on wavyleaf thistle. The earlier R. conicus was active, the less it oviposited on wavyleaf thistle, even when weevils were abundant. Neither weevil abundance nor availability of wavyleaf flower heads predicted R. conicus egg load. Instead, the strongest predictor of R. conicus egg load on wavyleaf thistle was the availability of flower heads on Platte thistle, the more common, earlier flowering native thistle in the sand prairie. Egg load on wavyleaf thistle decreased as the number of Platte thistle flower heads at a site increased. Thus, wavyleaf thistle experienced associational defense in the presence of flowering by its now declining native congener, Platte thistle. These results demonstrate that prediction of damage to a native plant by an exotic insect may require knowledge of both likely phenological synchrony and total resource availability to the herbivore, including resources provided by other nontarget native species.},

	abstract = {Size-dependent reproductive effort is an important component of plant fitness. The responses of reproductive effort to environmental factors in Amaranthus retroflexus L.were measured in two experiments. A wide range of selection pressures were generated by manipulating the sowing date (29 April, 23 May, 18 June, and 14 July) and planting density (13.4, 36, 121, and 441 plants·m-2). Allometric analysis between reproductive biomass and vegetative biomass across treatments showed that reproductive effort increased with size in response to different planting densities but decreased with size in sowing dates experiment. The allometric exponent between treatments was not influenced by planting densities but had significant variation with sowing date. Total branch length could explain most of the variation of reproductive accumulation and allocation in planting density experiments. For the plants with different sowing dates, total branch length was the main determinant of reproductive biomass, while reproductive effort mainly depended on the number of primary branches per unit stem mass. Architectural constraints with size result in size-dependent reproduction. Size-dependent reproduction in A.retroflexus was influenced by available resources and environmental conditions through the mechanisms of self-regulation of architectural traits.L'effort de reproduction lié à la grosseur est un constituant important de la capacité d'adaptation des plantes. Les auteurs ont mesuré les réactions de l'effort de reproduction aux facteurs environnementaux, chez l'Amaranthus retroflexus L., au cours de deux expériences. Une large gamme de pressions sélectives a été générée en variant la date de semis (29 avril, 23 mai, 18 juin et 14 juillet) et la densité des plantes (13,4, 36, 121 et 441 plantes·m-2). L'analyse allométrique entre la biomasse reproductive et la biomasse végétative montre, pour l'ensemble des traitements, que l'effort reproductif augmente avec l'importance de la réaction à différentes densités des plants, mais diminue avec la dimension, selon la date du semis. Le coefficient d'allométrie entre les traitements n'est pas influencé par la densité des plants, mais montre une variation significative dans l'expérience sur les dates des semis. La longueur totale de la branche peut expliquer la majeure partie de la variation de l'accumulation et de l'allocation reproductives, dans les expériences sur la densité des plants. Chez les plants qui différent par la date du semis, la longueur totale de la branche est le facteur déterminant principal de la biomasse reproductive, alors que l'effort de reproduction dépend surtout du nombre de branches primaires par unité de masse caulinaire. Les contraintes architecturales liées à la dimension conduisent à une reproduction dépendant de la dimension. La reproduction liée à la dimension, chez l'A. retroflexus, est influencée par les ressources disponibles et les conditions environnementales, via les mécanismes autorégulateurs des caractères architecturaux.},

In Arabidopsis thaliana, hydrolysis by the enzyme, myrosinase, produces bioactive nitriles, epithionitriles, or isothiocyanates depending upon the plant's genotype and the glucosinolate's structure. A major determinant of this structural specificity is the epithiospecifier locus (ESP), whose protein causes the formation of epithionitriles and nitriles. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 3 epistatically affects nitrile formation in combination with ESP; this QTL has been termed EPITHIOSPECIFIER MODIFIER1 (ESM1). We identified a myrosinase-associated protein as the ESM1 QTL in Arabidopsis using map-based cloning with recombinant inbred lines, natural variation transcriptomic analysis, and metabolic profiling. In planta and in vitro analyses with natural ESM1 alleles, ESM1 knockouts, and overexpression lines show that ESM1 represses nitrile formation and favors isothiocyanate production. The glucosinolate hydrolysis profile change influenced by ESM1 is associated with the ability to deter herbivory by Trichoplusia ni. This gene could provide unique approaches toward improving human nutrition.},

Consequently, many of the new and planned developments in comparative analysis already have well-tested solutions in quantitative genetics. In this paper, we take three recent publications that develop phylogenetic meta-analysis, either implicitly or explicitly, and show how they can be considered as quantitative genetic models. We highlight some of the difficulties with the proposed solutions, and demonstrate that standard quantitative genetic theory and software offer solutions. We also show how results from Bayesian quantitative genetics can be used to create efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for phylogenetic mixed models, thereby extending their generality to non-Gaussian data. Of particular utility is the development of multinomial models for analysing the evolution of discrete traits, and the development of multi-trait models in which traits can follow different distributions. Meta-analyses often include a nonrandom collection of species for which the full phylogenetic tree has only been partly resolved. Using missing data theory, we show how the presented models can be used to correct for nonrandom sampling and show how taxonomies and phylogenies can be combined to give a flexible framework with which to model dependence.},

We explore the use of angiosperm plants as hosts for nymphalid butterflies, and in particular the evidence for past oscillations in host range and how they are linked to host shifts and to diversification. At the level of orders of plants, a relatively simple pattern of host use and host shifts emerges, despite the 100 million years of history of the family Nymphalidae. We review the evidence that these host shifts and the accompanying diversifications were associated with transient polyphagous stages, as suggested by the “oscillation hypothesis.” In addition, we investigate all currently polyphagous nymphalid species and demonstrate that the state of polyphagy is rare, has a weak phylogenetic signal, and a very apical distribution in the phylogeny; we argue that these are signs of its transient nature. We contrast our results with data from the bark beetles Dendroctonus, in which a more specialized host use is instead the apical state. We conclude that plasticity in host use is likely to have contributed to diversification in nymphalid butterflies.},

We characterized geographic patterns of genetic variation in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana by genotyping 115 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in 351 accessions from the whole species range using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight assay, and by sequencing of nine unlinked short genomic regions in a subset of 64 accessions. The observed frequency distribution of SNPs is not consistent with a constant-size neutral model of sequence polymorphism due to an excess of rare polymorphisms. There is evidence for a significant population structure as indicated by differences in genetic diversity between geographic regions. Accessions from Central Asia have a low level of polymorphism and an increased level of genome-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) relative to accessions from the Iberian Peninsula and Central Europe. Cluster analysis with the structure program grouped Eurasian accessions into K=6 clusters. Accessions from the Iberian Peninsula and from Central Asia constitute distinct populations, whereas Central and Eastern European accessions represent admixed populations in which genomes were reshuffled by historical recombination events. These patterns likely result from a rapid postglacial recolonization of Eurasia from glacial refugial populations. Our analyses suggest that mapping populations for association or LD mapping should be chosen from regional rather than a species-wide sample or identified genetically as sets of individuals with similar average genetic distances.},

These tests give some clues to the possible shape of the genetic landscape. Nevertheless, correlation analyses fail when attempting to identify where genetic barriers exist, namely, the areas where a given variable shows an abrupt rate of change. To this end, a computational geometry approach is more suitable because it provides the locations and the directions of barriers and because it can show where geographic patterns of two or more variables are similar. In this frame we have implemented Monmonier's (1973) maximum difference algorithm in a new software package to identify genetic barriers. To provide a more realistic representation of the barriers in a genetic landscape, we implemented in the software a significance test by means of bootstrap matrices analysis. As a result, the noise associated with genetic markers can be visualized on a geographic map and the areas where genetic barriers are more robust can be identified. Moreover, this multiple matrices approach can visualize the patterns of variation associated with different markers in the same overall picture. This improved Monmonier's method is highly reliable and can be applied to nongenetic data whenever sampling locations and a distance matrix between corresponding data are available.},

This interplay complicates understanding of fitness costs and benefits of plant chemical defenses. We are studying the role of the glucosinolate-myrosinase chemical defense system in protecting Arabidopsis thaliana from specialist and generalist insect herbivory. We used two Arabidopsis recombinant inbred populations in which we had previously mapped QTL controlling variation in the glucosinolate-myrosinase system. In this study we mapped QTL controlling resistance to specialist (Plutella xylostella) and generalist (Trichoplusia ni) herbivores. We identified a number of QTL that are specific to one herbivore or the other, as well as a single QTL that controls resistance to both insects. Comparison of QTL for herbivory, glucosinolates, and myrosinase showed that T. ni herbivory is strongly deterred by higher glucosinolate levels, faster breakdown rates, and specific chemical structures. In contrast, P. xylostella herbivory is uncorrelated with variation in the glucosinolate-myrosinase system. This agrees with evolutionary theory stating that specialist insects may overcome host plant chemical defenses, whereas generalists will be sensitive to these same defenses.},

	abstract = {Ecology Letters (2011) 14: 1084–1092 Abstract Rapid evolution challenges the assumption that evolution is too slow to impact short-term ecological dynamics. This insight motivates the study of ‘Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics’ or how evolution and ecological processes reciprocally interact on short time scales. We tested how rapid evolution impacts concurrent population dynamics using an aphid (Myzus persicae) and an undomesticated host (Hirschfeldia incana) in replicated wild populations. We manipulated evolvability by creating non-evolving (single clone) and potentially evolving (two-clone) aphid populations that contained genetic variation in intrinsic growth rate. We observed significant evolution in two-clone populations whether or not they were exposed to predators and competitors. Evolving populations grew up to 42\% faster and attained up to 67\% higher density, compared with non-evolving control populations but only in treatments exposed to competitors and predators. Increased density also correlates with relative fitness of competing clones suggesting a full eco-evolutionary dynamic cycle defined as reciprocal interactions between evolution and density.},

	abstract = {Patterns of herbivory may vary with fine-scale plant community structure: the degree of damage plants experience may depend on their neighbors (i.e., associational resistance or susceptibility). Differential herbivory, in turn, may facilitate a shift in plant community structure. We investigated these reciprocal effects of plant community structure and insect herbivory in a field mesocosm experiment with closely related, native Asteraceae that co-occur in early-successional habitats (old fields). After one year of establishment, we excluded or augmented insect herbivores for two years in equal-density communities of three types: goldenrod-dominated (Solidago spp.) or aster-dominated (Symphyotrichum spp.) congeneric communities and mixtures of the two genera. In manipulated outbreaks, overall and species-specific patterns of herbivory by the main herbivore, the leaf beetle Trirhabda virgata, varied dramatically with community composition. In both years, the preferred goldenrods suffered 25−70\% higher defoliation in mixtures with the less-preferred asters (i.e., associational susceptibility), compared to when growing with congeners; in contrast, asters experienced lower damage in mixtures (i.e., associational resistance). Insect herbivory consistently reduced overall plant productivity, and promoted colonization by other old-field species. Importantly, herbivory also initiated a shift in the structure of the plant communities, and this effect depended on the starting community composition, implying potential reciprocal effects. For instance, only in mixtures did elevated herbivory reduce the proportional abundance of the preferred host, and the old-field dominant, Solidago altissima. Our findings underscore the importance of plant community composition for variation in and impacts of herbivory and suggest the possibility of feedbacks between herbivory and local community structure as one of the mechanisms contributing to the maintenance of vegetation heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {@'Switching@' in predators which attack several prey species potentially can stabilize the numbers in prey populations. In switching, the number of attacks upon a species is disproportionately large when the species is abundant relative to other prey, and disproportionately small when the species is relatively rare. The null case for two prey species can be written: P"1/P"2 = cN"1/N"2, where P"1/P"2 is the ratio of the two prey expected in the diet, N"1/N"2 is the ratio given and c is a proportionality constant. Predators were sea-shore snails and prey were mussels and barnacles. Experiments in the laboratory modelled aspects of various natural situations. When the predator had a strong preference (c) between prey the data and the @'null case@' model were in good agreement. Preference could not altered by subjecting predators to training regimens. When preference was weak the data did not fit the model replicates were variable. Predators could be trained easily to one or other prey species. From a number of experiments it was concluded that in the weak-preference case no switch would occur in nature except where there is an opportunity for predators to become trained to the abundant species. A patchy distribution of the abundant prey could provide this opportunity. Given one prey species, snails caused a decreasing percentage mortality as prey numbers increased. This occurred also with 2 prey species present when preference was strong. When preference was weak the form of the response was unclear. When switching occurred the percentage prey mortality increased with prey density, giving potentially stabilizing mortality. The consequences of these conclusions for prey population regulation and for diversity are discussed.},

	abstract = {Climatic change is expected to affect the extent and severity of geometrid moth outbreaks, a major disturbance factor in sub-arctic birch forests. Previous studies have reported that the two geometrid species involved, autumnal moth and winter moth, differ in their temperature requirements and, consequently, in their altitudinal and latitudinal distribution patterns. In this study, we document the altitudinal distribution of winter moth outbreaks in a large coastal area in northern Norway. We show that, in the present winter moth outbreak, defoliated birch stands were seen as distinct zones with a rather constant width in the uppermost part of the forest and where the upper limit coincided with the forest line. The outbreak zone closely followed the spatially variable forest line as an undulating belt, although some of the variation in outbreak zone width was also related to variation in topographical variables, such as distance from the coast, forest line altitude, and slope of the terrain. A distinct outbreak zone at the altitudinal forest line is the typical picture that has been depicted in more qualitative historical records on previous outbreaks of autumnal moth rather than winter moth. We suggest that the recent documented climate warming in this region may have induced a shift in distribution of the winter moth both relative to topography and geography. Further investigation is, however, required to substantiate these suspicions.},

	abstract = {In natural populations of Thymus vulgaris in the south of France, six genetically different chemical “chemotypes” occur, each differentiated by a single dominant monoterpene that gives individual plants a characteristic smell and taste. Individual populations may contain all six chemotypes, but are often dominated by one to three chemotypes. We tested the hypothesis that this chemical polymorphism was associated with selective herbivory by the snail Helix aspersa, which feeds upon T. vulgaris in nature. The relative preference of juvenile and adult molluscs was investigated by presenting individual animals with a choice of six chemotypes in three experimental trials: (1) whole plants, (2) nutritive gels containing crushed thyme leaves, and (3) nutritive gels containing a distilled monoterpene as an additive. We found significant and consistent patterns of preference. Adult and immature molluscs preferred the linalol chemotype, and ate carvacrol and thymol-containing foods the least. This preference was more marked when using the gels than the real plants, particularly the monoterpene-based gels, demonstrating the importance of the monoterpene for the choice. Furthermore, molluscs fed exclusively on linalol-containing food gained weight whereas those fed on carvacrol-containing food lost weight. After being fed these exclusive diets both groups showed a significant preference for linalol. These results (1) demonstrate that food choice is based upon the presence of specific monoterpenes and is not learned, (2) suggest that phenolic monoterpenes such as carvacrol are repellent to the animals, and (3) indicate that selective herbivory may play a significant role in the maintenance of the chemical polymorphism of T. vulgaris.},

We reviewed the literature from 1984 through 1997 for studies that estimated the strength of linear and quadratic selection in terms of standardized selection gradients or differentials on natural variation in quantitative traits for field populations. We tabulated 63 published studies of 62 species that reported over 2,500 estimates of linear or quadratic selection. More than 80\% of the estimates were for morphological traits; there is very little data for behavioral or physiological traits. Most published selection studies were unreplicated and had sample sizes below 135 individuals, resulting in low statistical power to detect selection of the magnitude typically reported for natural populations. The absolute values of linear selection gradients {\textbackslash}textbarβ{\textbackslash}textbar were exponentially distributed with an overall median of 0.16, suggesting that strong directional selection was uncommon. The values of {\textbackslash}textbarβ{\textbackslash}textbar for selection on morphological and on life‐history/phenological traits were significantly different: on average, selection on morphology was stronger than selection on phenology/life history. Similarly, the values of {\textbackslash}textbarβ{\textbackslash}textbar for selection via aspects of survival, fecundity, and mating success were significantly different: on average, selection on mating success was stronger than on survival. Comparisons of estimated linear selection gradients and differentials suggest that indirect components of phenotypic selection were usually modest relative to direct components. The absolute values of quadratic selection gradients {\textbackslash}textbarγ{\textbackslash}textbar were exponentially distributed with an overall median of only 0.10, suggesting that quadratic selection is typically quite weak. The distribution of γ values was symmetric about 0, providing no evidence that stabilizing selection is stronger or more common than disruptive selection in nature.},

Four of the seven defence mutants had significantly higher size-standardized growth rates (SGRs) than the wild-type in early life, although this benefit declined as plants grew larger. SGR is known to be a good predictor of success under high-density conditions, and we confirmed that mutants with higher growth rates had a large advantage when grown in competition. Despite the lack of differences in flowering-time genes, the mutants differed in flowering time, a trait that strongly correlated with early growth rate. Aphid herbivory decreased plant growth rate and increased flowering time, and aphid population growth rate was closely coupled to the growth rate of the host plant. Small differences in early SGR thus had cascading effects on both flowering time and herbivore populations.},

For herbivorous insects, the preference–performance hypothesis (PPH) states that female insects will evolve to oviposit on hosts on which their offspring fare best. In this study, we use meta-analysis to assess the balance of evidence for and against the PPH, and to evaluate the role of individual factors proposed to influence host selection by female insects. We do so in an explicitly bitrophic context (herbivores versus plants). Overall, our analyses offer clear support for the PPH: Offspring survive better on preferred plant types, and females lay more eggs on plant types conducive to offspring performance. We also found evidence for an effect of diet breadth on host choice: female preference for ‘good quality plants’ was stronger in oligophagous insects than in polyphagous insects. Nonetheless, despite the large numbers of preference–performance studies conducted to date, sample sizes in our meta-analysis are low due to the inconsistent format used by authors to present their results. To improve the situation, we invite authors to contribute to the data base emerging from this work, with the aim of reaching a strengthened synthesis of the subject field.},

Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark–recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

	abstract = {Trophic structure, the partitioning of biomass among trophic levels, is a major characteristic of ecosystems. Most studies of the forces that shape trophic structure emphasize either "bottom-up" or "top-down" regulation of populations and communities. Recent work has shown that these two forces are not mutually exclusive alternatives, but efforts to model their interaction still often yield unrealistic predictions. We focus on the problems involved with modeling situations in which community composition, including both the number of trophic levels and the species composition within a trophic level, can change. We review the development of these ideas, emphasizing in particular how compositional change can alter theoretical expectations about the regulation of trophic structure. A comparison of studies on the effects of predators and resource productivity in limnetic ecosystems reveals an intriguing disparity between the results of manipulative experiments and those of correlational studies. We suggest that this contrast is a result of the difference in the temporal scales operating in the two types of studies. Ecosystem-level variables may appear to approach an equilibrium in short-term press experiments; however, processes such as invasion and extinction of species will not have time to play out in most such experiments. We found that the responses of ecosystems to short-term experimental treatments involve less change in species composition than is found in natural communities that have diverged in response to local conditions over longer periods. We argue that the results of short-term experiments support the predictions of models in which the species pool does not change, whereas correlational studies among systems support theories that incorporate compositional change.},

	abstract = {The influence of negative species interactions has dominated much of the literature on community assembly rules. Patterns of negative covariation among species are typically documented through null model analyses of binary presence/absence matrices in which rows designate species, columns designate sites, and the matrix entries indicate the presence (1) or absence (0) of a particular species in a particular site. However, the outcome of species interactions ultimately depends on population-level processes. Therefore, patterns of species segregation and aggregation might be more clearly expressed in abundance matrices, in which the matrix entries indicate the abundance or density of a species in a particular site. We conducted a series of benchmark tests to evaluate the performance of 14 candidate null model algorithms and six covariation metrics that can be used with abundance matrices. We first created a series of random test matrices by sampling a metacommunity from a lognormal species abundance distribution. We also created a series of structured matrices by altering the random matrices to incorporate patterns of pairwise species segregation and aggregation. We next screened each algorithm–index combination with the random and structured matrices to determine which tests had low Type I error rates and good power for detecting segregated and aggregated species distributions. In our benchmark tests, the best-performing null model does not constrain species richness, but assigns individuals to matrix cells proportional to the observed row and column marginal distributions until, for each row and column, total abundances are reached. Using this null model algorithm with a set of four covariance metrics, we tested for patterns of species segregation and aggregation in a collection of 149 empirical abundance matrices and 36 interaction matrices collated from published papers and posted data sets. More than 80\% of the matrices were significantly segregated, which reinforces a previous meta-analysis of presence/absence matrices. However, using two of the metrics we detected a significant pattern of aggregation for plants and for the interaction matrices (which include plant–pollinator data sets). These results suggest that abundance matrices, analyzed with an appropriate null model, may be a powerful tool for quantifying patterns of species segregation and aggregation.},

This diversification is reflected at the phytochemical level in their production of numerous specialized secondary metabolites that provide protection against biotic and abiotic stresses. Plant speciation is therefore intimately linked to metabolic diversification, yet we do not currently have a deep understanding of how new metabolic pathways evolve. Recent evidence indicates that genes for individual secondary metabolic pathways can be either distributed throughout the genome or clustered, but the relative frequencies of these two pathway organizations remain to be established. While it is possible that clustering is a feature of pathways that have evolved in recent evolutionary time, the answer to this and how dispersed and clustered pathways may be related remain to be addressed. Recent advances enabled by genomics and systems biology are beginning to yield the first insights into network evolution in plant metabolism. This review focuses on recent progress in understanding the evolution of clustered and dispersed pathways for new secondary metabolites in plants.},

	abstract = {Aim We examine a presence–absence matrix of the avifauna of the Bismarck Archipelago, for which the concept of competitively driven community assembly rules was formulated, to determine whether data support widespread competitive determination of geographical distributions. Location Bismarck Archipelago. Methods We obtained occurrences of 154 land and freshwater bird species on 31 islands. We calculated the observed number of checkerboards for all species pairs, for congeneric species pairs and for pairs of species within guilds, and employed randomization techniques to detect unusual co-occurrence patterns. Results Compared with random expectations, there are excesses of checkerboard pairs within both genera and defined guilds, but a detailed examination shows that competition is a cogent possible explanation in few instances. For many checkerboard pairs, species are not widely interspersed but are regionally allopatric, which probably reflects historical biogeography and dispersal limitation. Most congeneric and intraguild checkerboards include a species classified as a supertramp; when supertramps are omitted, there are 11 congeneric checkerboards and four intraguild but heterogeneric checkerboards. Main conclusions In isolation, presence–absence matrices provide limited insight into the role of competition in structuring bird communities of the Bismarcks. A major problem is disentangling historical geography and colonization history of the archipelago from the present-day ecology of the species. Examination of observed checkerboards from a geographically explicit perspective and with knowledge of colonization routes suggests that many checkerboards are likely to result, at least in part, from historical biogeography and supertramps. Although species may be forced into supertramp status by competition, other factors (e.g. habitat preference) may be causal, and biogeographical distributions alone cannot distinguish between causes.},

Female-limited colour polymorphism in damselflies is a counter-adaptation to male mating harassment, and thus, is expected to alter population dynamics through relaxing sexual conflict. Here we show the side effect of the evolution of female morph diversity on population performance (for example, population productivity and sustainability) in damselflies. Our theoretical model incorporating key features of the sexual interaction predicts that the evolution of increased phenotypic diversity will reduce overall fitness costs to females from sexual conflict, which in turn will increase productivity, density and stability of a population. Field data and mesocosm experiments support these model predictions. Our study suggests that increased phenotypic diversity can enhance population performance that can potentially reduce extinction rates and thereby influence macroevolutionary processes.},

	abstract = {1. Life table response experiment (LTRE) analyses decompose treatment effects on a dependent variable (usually, but not necessarily, population growth rate) into contributions from differences in the parameters that determine that variable. 2. Fixed, random and regression LTRE designs have been applied to plant populations in many contexts. These designs all make use of the derivative of the dependent variable with respect to the parameters, and describe differences as sums of linear approximations. 3. Here, I extend LTRE methods to analyse treatment effects on the stochastic growth rate log λs. The problem is challenging because a stochastic model contains two layers of dynamics: the stochastic dynamics of the environment and the response of the vital rates to the state of the environment. I consider the widely used case where the environment is described by a Markov chain. 4. As the parameters describing the environmental Markov chain do not appear explicitly in the calculation of log λs, derivatives cannot be calculated. The solution presented here combines derivatives for the vital rates with an alternative (and older) approach, due to Kitagawa and Keyfitz, that calculates contributions in a way analogous to the calculation of main effects in statistical models. 5. The resulting LTRE analysis decomposes log λs into contributions from differences in: (i) the stationary distribution of environmental states, (ii) the autocorrelation pattern of the environment, and (iii) the stage-specific vital rate responses within each environmental state. 6. As an example, the methods are applied to a stage-classified model of the prairie plant Lomatium bradshawii in a stochastic fire environment. 7. Synthesis. The stochastic growth rate is an important parameter describing the effects of environmental fluctuations on population viability. Like any growth rate, it responds to differences in environmental factors. Without a decomposition analysis there is no way to attribute differences in the stochastic growth rate to particular parts of the life cycle or particular aspects of the stochastic environment. The methods presented here provide such an analysis, extending the LTRE analyses already available for deterministic environments.},

	abstract = {The existence and mode of selection operating on heritable adaptive traits can be inferred by comparing population differentiation in neutral genetic variation between populations (often using FST values) with the corresponding estimates for adaptive traits. Such comparisons indicate if selection acts in a diversifying way between populations, in which case differentiation in selected traits is expected to exceed differentiation in neutral markers [FST (selected) {\textbackslash}textgreater FST (neutral)], or if negative frequency-dependent selection maintains genetic polymorphisms and pulls populations towards a common stable equilibrium [FST (selected) {\textbackslash}textless FST (neutral)]. Here, we compared FST values for putatively neutral data (obtained using amplified fragment length polymorphism) with estimates of differentiation in morph frequencies in the colour-polymorphic damselfly Ischnura elegans. We found that in the first year (2000), population differentiation in morph frequencies was significantly greater than differentiation in neutral loci, while in 2002 (only 2 years and 2 generations later), population differentiation in morph frequencies had decreased to a level significantly lower than differentiation in neutral loci. Genetic drift as an explanation for population differentiation in morph frequencies could thus be rejected in both years. These results indicate that the type and/or strength of selection on morph frequencies in this system can change substantially between years. We suggest that an approach to a common equilibrium morph frequency across all populations, driven by negative frequency-dependent selection, is the cause of these temporal changes. We conclude that inferences about selection obtained by comparing FST values from neutral and adaptive genetic variation are most useful when spatial and temporal data are available from several populations and time points and when such information is combined with other ecological sources of data.},

Review of published ecological studies using path analysis suggests that path analysis is often misused and collinearity is a moderate to severe problem in a majority of the analyses. 2. Multiple regression is shown to be related to path analysis, and thus collinearity, which is a well-known problem in regression analysis, can also be a problem in path analysis. Collinearity occurs when independent variables are highly correlated and causes estimates of standardized partial regression coefficients and of path coefficients to be less precise, less accurate and prone to rounding error. 3. A review of 24 path analyses in 12 papers revealed incorrectly calculated path coefficients in 13 cases and problems with collinearity in 15 cases. Estimates of path coefficients are biased and lack precision if there is collinearity. 4. An additional 40 path analyses could not be evaluated because of incomplete information. Most studies lack sufficient sample size to justify the use of path analysis. Problems associated with the use of categorical variables, which were used in six cases, are unappreciated. 5.

The role of host plant cues is considered with respect to the surrounding vegetation and to the presence of competitors. Only very little is known on how enemies searching for prey influence a chrysomelid's choice for a plant. Finally, also the impact of phytopathogens on host location in Chrysomelidae is addressed. The pheno- and genotypic plasticity of chrysomelid host location behaviour might have facilitated pioneering new host plants. For a better understanding of adaptive evolution, we conclude that future studies on host plant location by chrysomelids need to address in addition to ecological and behaviourals aspects more intensively also the molecular questions of adaptation.},

Furthermore, host plant resistance to herbivory has been shown to affect natural enemies yet, this has not been investigated for vermicompost-mediated resistance. For these reasons, we tested the effects of plants grown in various vermicompost concentrations on the preference (antixenosis) and performance (antibiosis) of a generalist (Helicoverpa zea Boddie) and specialist (Pieris rapae L.) lepidopterous cabbage pests. We also tested the generalist parasitoid, Cotesia marginiventris Cresson responses to H. zea feeding on vermicompost grown plants. Insect preference was evaluated in leaf disc larval and whole plant oviposition choice assays. After 24 h of feeding, H. zea larvae showed no aversion for any vermicompost treatment or leaf age, and P. rapae larvae consumed more of younger leaves indiscriminate of vermicompost treatments. There was also no antixenosis effects against P. rapae adults, which oviposited significantly more on plants grown on 60\% vermicompost. Potential detrimental effects on performance was also evaluated in no-choice larval development assays. No significant treatment effects were found for H. zea development; however, vermicompost treatments had a significant negative effect on P. rapae survival. Vermicompost treatments did not have an effect on attraction or development of the parasitoid C. marginiventris. Results from this study suggest that the mechanism of resistance mediated by vermicompost is antibiosis, which results in lower performance and death of the specialist, but not the generalist insects tested in this study. Furthermore, this resistance appears to be caused by factors other than nutrient levels in plant tissue.},

Here, we assess the effect of altitude on the carbon and nitrogen isotope composition of the hair of ruminant grazers and its relation to grassland vegetation, to evaluate the use of hair isotope data for ecosystem reconstruction, animal nutritional ecology and biogeochemical studies in montane environments. Location European Alps. Methods We sampled grassland vegetation (pure C3) and the hair of ruminants along an altitudinal gradient (400–2500 m), and analysed their isotope composition (δ13C and δ15N). Results were compared with published effects of altitude on 13C in C3 plants at the species level and on 15N at the community level. The study was complemented with a comparison of diet and hair isotope composition in ruminants held in confinement. Results δ13C of hair increased (c. 1.1‰ km−1) and δ15N decreased (c. 1.1‰ km−1) with altitude. The same changes occurred in local grassland vegetation, and in regional to global grassland data sets. Offsets between hair and vegetation 13C or 15N (‘diet–hair shift’) were independent of altitude. Sheep (Ovis aries) and cattle (Bos taurus) exhibited a 13C shift near +3‰, but that of goats (Capra hircus) was larger (+4.2‰) in alpine environments and in confinement. The diet–hair shift for 15N was more variable (+2.1 to +3.6‰). Main conclusions Grazer hair provides a faithful spatially and temporally integrated record of grassland isotope composition, useful for ecosystem and environment reconstruction. The effect of altitude on hair 15N is important for studies of trophic relationships: an altitude shift of 2000 m produced the same effect in hair 15N as would a shift from an animal tissue-based to a plant-based diet. The similarity of altitude effects on δ13C of individual plant species, vegetation and hair indicates that the effect of altitude on species-level ‘intrinsic water use efficiency’ scales up linearly to the community and landscape level.},

The growth and the reproduction of this snail were studied in breeding aquaria and under laboratory conditions. The consumption rate of L stagnalis was recorded for eight macrophyte species in one choice experiment and two non-choice experiments performed in two consecutive years. The breeding of L stagnalis presented no difficulties. Within a few weeks, a single individual produced hundreds of young snails. In favourable conditions of temperature and water volume, these young specimens reached 30 mm shell length eight weeks after hatching. The feeding experiments demonstrated that the snails of this size can be used to accurately discriminate the palatability of macrophyte species. The feeding preferences of L. stagnalis did not significantly differ among the three experiments. The use of L. stagnalis as a model to study plant palatability in freshwater habitats is discussed from both a conceptual and a pragmatic point of view.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/1941033},
	abstract = {Dieffenbachia longispatha (Araceae) is pollinated by scarab beetles (Cyclocephala spp. and Erioscelis sp.) at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. The relative contributions of each beetle species to female reproductive success of D. longispatha were determined by observing inflorescences during the flowering seasons of 1982 and 1983 and recording the number of visiting beetles of each species. Fruit production was determined for each inflorescence as fruits ripened, 9 mo after flowering. The three most abundant beetle species differed in abundance, recapture rates, pollen loads carried, and behavior at inflorescences. Despite these differences, the effect of the single visit on fruit-set of D. longispatha (the @'pollinator effectiveness@' of each species) did not vary among the beetle species. The @'importance@' of each pollinator species, estimated in previous studies from the abundance and effectiveness of each species and determined in this study from examining fruit-sets of inflorescences visited by varying numbers of beetles, was not a positive, linear function of beetle abundance. In 1982, when visitation rate of all beetle species was low, fruit-set was positively correlated with the number of beetles in an inflorescence but @'per visit@' effectiveness decreased with increasing visitation, resulting in a saturation of fruit-set at 42\%. Beetle identity (to species) did not explain a significant proportion of the variance in fruit-wet in 1982. In 1983, beetle abundance quadrupled relative to 1982 and fruit-set was positively correlated with beetle numbers up to four, but visitation by more than four beetles resulted in a decreased in fruit-set. A high proportion of Cyclocephala gravis produced higher than predicted fruit-set, while a high proportion of Erioscelis yielded fruit-sets lower than was predicted by total number of beetles. The presence of large numbers of Eriosceliis within inflorescences in 1983 and the low fruit-sets of those inflorescences explained the significantly negative slope of the regression for inflorescences fisted by more than four beetles. Previous models have predicted saturation of fruit-set with increasing pollinator visitation (as seen in 1982) but have not predicted a significant decline in fruit-set with pollinator abundance. The proportion of the variance in fruit-set explained by beetle abundance was low for both years (2-8\%), suggesting that other factors contribute to female reproductive success in Dieffenbachia (i.e., number of potential mates and the distances to potential mates in the population). Use of common indices of pollinator contribution to seed set, such as pollinator abundance and the number of seeds produced as a result of a single visit, would lead to erroneous conclusions if applied to Dieffenbachia and its beetle pollinators, or to other pollination systems where there is cumulative floral damage with increasing visitation frequencies.},

Only in very few cases has the relationship between genetic variation at the molecular level, phenotype and function been established in natural populations. We examined the functional significance and genetic basis of a polymorphism in production of leaf hairs, trichomes, in the perennial herb Arabidopsis lyrata. Earlier studies suggested that trichome production is subject to divergent selection. Here we show that the production of trichomes is correlated with reduced damage from insect herbivores in natural populations, and using statistical methods developed for medical genetics we document an association between loss of trichome production and mutations in the regulatory gene GLABROUS1. Sequence data suggest that independent mutations in this regulatory gene have provided the basis for parallel evolution of reduced resistance to insect herbivores in different populations of A. lyrata and in the closely related Arabidopsis thaliana. The results show that candidate genes identified in model organisms provide a valuable starting point for analysis of the genetic basis of phenotypic variation in natural populations.},

Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations.

The macrobiological literature indicates that ecological disturbances can influence assembly processes. Thus, we sampled bacterial communities at 4 and 16 weeks following a wildfire and used null deviation analysis to examine the role that time since disturbance has in community assembly. Fire dramatically altered bacterial community structure and diversity as well as soil chemistry for both time-points. Community structure shifted between 4 and 16 weeks for both burned and unburned communities. Community assembly in burned sites 4 weeks after fire was significantly more stochastic than in unburned sites. After 16 weeks, however, burned communities were significantly less stochastic than unburned communities. Thus, we propose a three-phase model featuring shifts in the relative importance of niche and neutral processes as a function of time since disturbance. Because neutral processes are characterized by a decoupling between environmental parameters and community structure, we hypothesize that a better understanding of community assembly may be important in determining where and when detailed studies of community composition are valuable for predicting ecosystem function.},

	abstract = {* 1The California population of the pipevine swallowtail Battus philenor is a specialist on the Dutchman’s pipe Aristolochia californica, an endemic vine that is densely covered with trichomes. Populations of B. philenor outside California use other Aristolochia species that are largely glabrous. The average clutch size of the pipevine swallowtail is larger in California compared with populations elsewhere and larvae feed gregariously until late in the third instar. * 2In the field, caterpillars consumed more leaf material and showed preference for portions of leaves with trichomes removed. However, large groups of caterpillars were consistently observed feeding on the apical portion of the plant, where trichome density was highest. Smaller groups of caterpillars were observed feeding more often on mature leaves on the lower portions of the plant, where trichome density was lower. * 3Laboratory experiments showed that the walking speed of a commonly observed predator, larvae of the green lacewing Chrysopa carnea, was reduced as trichome density increased. Furthermore, lacewing search efficiency and capture rate of a model prey item were compromised by high trichome density. * 4In an additional field experiment, no difference was found in the percentage mortality of groups of four and 12 caterpillars. However, growth rate of the larger group was accelerated by 25\% compared with smaller groups. In an experiment using a ladybird beetle larva Hippodamia convergens as the predator, no difference was observed in absolute mortality of caterpillars, suggesting that group size does not function directly as a defence against predators. * 5First instar caterpillars are most vulnerable to predators, thus feeding in larger groups may benefit caterpillars by accelerating growth. Feeding in large groups may also be an effective strategy for B. philenor to overcome plant trichomes and feed on portions of the plant conducive to faster development. However, feeding on areas with dense trichomes does not appear to provide larvae with a refuge from predators.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/1939002},
	abstract = {Labidomera clivicollis (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae, Doryphorini), the milkweed leaf beetle, is relatively rare in New York State, although one of its host plants (Asclepias syriaca) is abundant. A related species, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, is an economic pest of potatoes. A comparison of the population dynamics of Labiodomera with previously published information on L. decemlineata suggests that the major differing factor controlling the two species' relative abundance is the intensity of predation to which the larvae are exposed. Predation on the young Labidomera larvae on the foliage of the host plants was the most important mortality factor in field experiments. Newly hatched beetle larvae were placed on 16 A. syriaca plants under natural conditions, in one of four treatment: (1) cage over the plant, with an open bottom; (2) sticky-trap barrier and groundcloth around the plant's base; (3) both barrier around base and cage over plant; and (4) control plants. The mortality could then be separated into four components: abiotic mortality, ground-dispersed predation, air-dispersed, and spider predation-plus-cannibalism. The rate of larval mortality on the control plants was high, averaging 35\% per day; all of the 112 control larvae (on four plants) died by day 12 of the experiment. Ground-dispersed predation alone accounted for 54\% of the total mortality. Important predators included Nabidae, Pentatomidae and Syrphidae (larvae); they were generalized, not specialized, arthropod predators. Another field experiment investigated the effect of different clutch sizes on larval mortality rates, with and without sticky barriers. The protective effect of the barriers, and hence the important of ground-dispersed predators, was confirmed in the second experiment. These results suggest that the beetle's preference for swamp milkweed for oviposition may be adaptive to avoid ground-dispersed predation. Swamp milkweeds frequently grow in marsh habitats with water around the base of the plants. Larvae on these plants would be protected by a @'moat effect.@' A review of the literature on field experiments with Leptinotarsa suggests that an analogous @'bare ground effect@' protects the larvae on cultivated potatoes from effective predation.},

Trichome-producing (hairy) and trichomeless (glabrous) plants of Arabidopsis halleri subsp. gemmifera were investigated to test whether plant resistance to herbivory depends on the plants' phenotypes and/or the phenotypes of neighbouring plants (associational effects). 2. A common garden experiment was conducted in which the relative frequency of hairy and glabrous plants was manipulated. Two species of leaf-chewing insects (larvae of a white butterfly and a cabbage sawfly) were found less often on hairy plants than on glabrous plants. By contrast, the numbers of aphids and flea beetles did not differ significantly between hairy and glabrous plants. For none of these insects did abundance depend on the frequency of the two plant morphs. 3. A field survey was conducted in two natural populations of A. halleri. In the first population, a species of white butterfly was the dominant herbivore, and hairy plants incurred less leaf damage than glabrous plants across 2 years. By contrast, in the other population, where flea beetles were dominant, there were no consistent differences in leaf damage between the two types of plants. In neither of the two populations was any evidence found of associational effects. 4. This study did not provide any conclusive evidence of associational effects of anti-herbivore resistance, but it was discovered that trichomes can confer resistance to certain herbivores. Given the results of previous work by the authors on associational effects against a flightless leaf beetle, such associational effects of the trichome dimorphism of A. halleri were herbivore-specific.},

Here we propose that herbivore-induced evolutionary increases in host plant resistance may cause oligophagous insect herbivores to shift to other sympatric plants as currently preferred host plants become increasingly unpalatable. We tested this hypothesis in a system based on the perennial herb Filipendula ulmaria (Rosaceae), whose herbivory defense has become gradually stronger due to prolonged selection by Galerucella tenella (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) herbivory in a boreal archipelago. We show that Galerucella gradually increases its use of the alternative host plant Rubus arcticus (Rosaceae) in parallel to gradually increased resistance in Filipendula. Our results imply that, by driving the evolutionary increase in Filipendula resistance, Galerucella is also gradually making the original host species more unpalatable and thereby driving its own host-breadth enlargement. We argue that such self-inflicted "rent rises" may be an important mechanism behind host plant shifts, which in turn are believed to have preceded the speciation of many phytophagous insects.},

	abstract = {Abstract A major challenge in evolutionary biology is understanding how stochastic and deterministic factors interact and influence macroevolutionary dynamics in natural populations. One classical approach is to record frequency changes of heritable and visible genetic polymorphisms over multiple generations. Here, we combined this approach with a maximum likelihood–based population-genetic model with the aim of understanding and quantifying the evolutionary processes operating on a female mating polymorphism in the blue-tailed damselfly Ischnura elegans. Previous studies on this color-polymorphic species have suggested that males form a search image for females, which leads to excessive mating harassment of common female morphs. We analyzed a large temporally and spatially replicated data set of between-generation morph frequency changes in I. elegans. Morph frequencies were more stable than expected from genetic drift alone, suggesting the presence of selection toward a stable equilibrium that prevents local loss or fixation of morphs. This can be interpreted as the signature of negative frequency-dependent selection maintaining the phenotypic stasis and genetic diversity in these populations. Our novel analytical approach allows the estimation of the strength of frequency-dependent selection from the morph frequency fluctuations around their inferred long-term equilibria. This approach can be extended and applied to other polymorphic organisms for which time-series data across multiple generations are available.},

Many studies have evidenced the uncertainty related to this kind of analysis due to sampling effort bias and the need for its quantification. Despite that a number of methods are available for that, little is known about their statistical limitations and discrimination capability, which could seriously constrain their use. We assess for the first time the discrimination capacity of two widely used methods and a proposed new one (FIDEGAM), all based on species accumulation curves, under different scenarios of sampling exhaustiveness using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses. Additionally, we examine to what extent the output of each method represents the sampling completeness in a simulated scenario where the true species richness is known. Finally, we apply FIDEGAM to a real situation and explore the spatial patterns of plant diversity in a National Park. FIDEGAM showed an excellent discrimination capability to distinguish between well and poorly sampled areas regardless of sampling exhaustiveness, whereas the other methods failed. Accordingly, FIDEGAM values were strongly correlated with the true percentage of species detected in a simulated scenario, whereas sampling completeness estimated with other methods showed no relationship due to null discrimination capability. Quantifying sampling effort is necessary to account for the uncertainty in biodiversity analyses, however, not all proposed methods are equally reliable. Our comparative analysis demonstrated that FIDEGAM was the most accurate discriminator method in all scenarios of sampling exhaustiveness, and therefore, it can be efficiently applied to most databases in order to enhance the reliability of biodiversity analyses.},

Among several morphological and ecophysiological traits evaluated, only four traits showed differentiation among populations in plasticity to soil moisture: leaf area, leaf shape, leaf area ratio (LAR), and foliar trichome density. In all of these traits plasticity to drought was greatest in plants from the population with the highest interannual variation in precipitation. We further tested the adaptive nature of these plastic responses by evaluating the relationship between phenotypic traits and total biomass, as a proxy for plant fitness, in the low water environment. Foliar trichome density appears to be the only trait that shows adaptive patterns of plasticity to drought.

In choice experiments using various models, surface texture was found to be an important factor influencing ovipositional behaviour, with females preferring to lay on smoother rather than rougher surfaces. Another surface texture feature that influenced oviposition was a raised wax ridge on a smooth surface. The wax ridge stimulated more eggs to be laid within close proximity to the ridge. Observations of females showed that the increased numbers of eggs laid on models with a wax ridge resulted not from increased landing, time spent, or numbers of eggs laid per ovipositional bout, but rather through an increased probability of ovipositing after landing on models with a wax ridge compared to models without the ridge. Spatial features of the models were also found to influence egglaying by females. Females showed a tendency to lay on the upper rather than the lower surface of models, although this appeared to depend upon how stimulatory the upper surface of the model was. Females also laid more eggs on models with a dense array of leaves than on models with a more spread-out array.},

	abstract = {Insects often undergo regular outbreaks in population density but identifying the causal mechanism for such outbreaks in any particular species has proven difficult. Here, we show that outbreak cycles in the tea tortrix Adoxophyes honmai can be explained by temperature-driven changes in system stability. Wavelet analysis of a 51-year time series spanning more than 200 outbreaks reveals a threshold in outbreak amplitude each spring when temperature exceeds 15°C and a secession of outbreaks each fall as temperature decreases. This is in close agreement with our independently parameterized mathematical model that predicts the system crosses a Hopf bifurcation from stability to sustained cycles as temperature increases. These results suggest that temperature can alter system stability and provide an explanation for generation cycles in multivoltine insects. Insect Cycles Rapid increases in insect populatio n sizes can result in significant crop losses. Seasonal temperature has been proposed to drive such outbreaks. Despite clear evidence that temperature can drive individual insect development, its influence at the population level is much less clear. Nelson et al. (p. 796, published online 1 August) analyzed data collected over 50 years on the tea tortrix moth, which affects Japanese tea plantations, to reveal the impacts of temperature on cyclical outbreaks.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Over the past 20 yr much has been learned about a unique symbiotic interaction between fungal endophytes and grasses. The fungi (Clavicipitaceae, Ascomycota) grow intercellularly and systemically in aboveground plant parts. Vertically transmitted asexual endophytes forming asymptomatic infections of cool‐season grasses have been repeatedly derived from sexual species that abort host inflorescences. The phylogenetic distribution of seed‐transmitted endophytes is strongly suggestive of cocladogenesis with their hosts. Molecular evidence indicates that many seed‐transmitted endophytes are interspecific hybrids. Superinfection may result in hyphal fusion and parasexual recombination. Most endophytes produce one or more alkaloid classes that likely play some role in defending the host plant against pests. Hybridization may have led to the proliferation of alkaloid‐production genes among asexual endophytes, favoring hybrids. The ergot alkaloid ergovaline, lolitrems, and lolines are produced by only a single sexual species, Epichloë festucae, but they are common in seed‐transmitted endophytes, suggesting that E. festucae contributed genes for their synthesis. Asexual hybrids may also be favored by the counteracting of the accumulation of deleterious mutations (Muller's rachet). Endophyte infection can provide other benefits, such as enhanced drought tolerance, photosynthetic rate, and growth. Estimates of infection frequency have revealed variable levels of infection with especially high prevalence in the subfamily Pooideae. Longitudinal studies suggest that the prevalence of seed‐transmitted endophytes can increase rapidly over time. In field experiments, infected tall fescue suppressed other grasses and forbs relative to uninfected fescue and supported lower consumer populations. Unlike other widespread plant/microbial symbioses based on the acquisition of mineral resources, grass/endophyte associations are based primarily on protection of the host from biotic and abiotic stresses.},

	abstract = {The influence of variability in nectar reward per flower on the foraging behavior of individual bumblebees (Bombus sandersoni Fkln.) and paper wasps (Vespula vulgaris L.) was explored during late summer 1979. The area around each colony was enclosed in mosquito netting, and an artificial floral patch, yellow and blue cardboard squares randomly mixed and fixed beneath wells in a clear sheet of plexiglass, was established within the enclosure. The nectar reward per flower (i.e., the volume) was manipulated to generate different degrees of variability within a floral type. The first set of experiments had equal quantities of nectar in all yellow and blue flowers. Individual foraging bees showed a significant preference for yellow. However, when blue flowers were kept constant (2 @mL in each) and yellow made variable (6 @mL in every third flower and none in the remainder), individual foragers avoided the variable yellow even though the expected reward from yellow was equal to blue. As a control, the variable floral type was reversed with yellow now constant. Individual foragers then showed an equally strong avoidance of blue flowers. In order to insure that bees were avoiding uncertainty rather than merely avoiding empty flowers, a new set of experiments was run with some nectar in every flower. The constant floral type contained 2 @mL of nectar in every flower while the variable type contained 5 @mL in every third and .5 @mL in the remainder. Again the foragers preferred the constant floral type; however, the preference was not as great as when there were empty flowers. Analysis of the sequence of visits made by individual forages seems to indicate that bees learned to distinguish the variable floral type during the foraging bout. Similar experiments were run on the wasps. When flowers were of equal quality, the wasps preferred yellow to blue. When one floral type was variable and the other constant, the wasps preferred the constant type. For the same magnitude of variability, however, the bumblebee's avoidance of the variable floral type was more pronounced than was the wasps' response. The results of these experiments are then analyzed within the context of a more general model of foraging behavior in variable environments.},

In particular, we examine the role of recent ecological perturbations in influencing pollen limitation and discuss the relation between pollen limitation and plant traits.

	abstract = {The effects of leaf toughness, trichome characteristics, nutrient and water availability, and secondary chemistry on diet selection by the leafcutting ant Atta cephalotes were determined using individuals of 49 woody plant species from a tropical deciduous forest in Costa Rica. The palability of plants was measured by presenting whole leaves to leafcutting ant foragers on trails and counting the number of pieces cut from leaves. The effectiveness of physical barriers to leaf cutting was evaluated by measuring the speed with which ants were able to cut leaves of varying toughness, trichome densities, and trichome lengths. Plant secondary chemistry was highly correlated with the relative palatability of leaves, while palatability was only marginally correlated with trichome characteristics and plant nutritional quality and was correlated with leaf toughness and water content. Highly palatable leaves generally contained hydrolyzable tannins, while most unpalatable leaves possessed nonpolar extracts found to deter leaf cutting in laboratory bioassays. Within the subset of highly palatable plants, leaf protein content was positively correlated with the number of pieces cut, indicating that secondary chemistry and nutrient availability interact to determine palatability. Decreases in plant palatability over time paralleled decreases in protein content. Ant size was the most important variable determining the rate at which ants cut leaves. Trichome characteristics were uncorrelated with the rate at which leaves were cut, while leaf toughness explained a small amount of the variance in cutting rate. The results suggest that leaf toughness and trichome characteristics within the ranges encountered by leafcutting ants in this tropical deciduous forest do not generally deter attack by ants. Instead, the results are consistent with the idea that leafcutting ants use a combination of plant secondary chemistry and nutrient availability to evaluate the quality of leaves.},

Samples were collected from the River Rhine and River Rhône in eastern France. The two populations of E. nuttallii differed in their introduction history, whereas E. canadensis was introduced at the same time in the two sites. The Daily Food Consumption (DFC) rates of the two macrophyte populations were evaluated in no-choice experiments using the scraper Lymnaea stagnalis and the shredder Gammarus roeseli. At the same time, we assessed four plant traits: dry matter content (DMC), total nitrogen content, carbon/nitrogen ratio and total phenolic content. The two populations of E. canadensis were consumed at low levels by both the herbivores. L. stagnalis showed a higher DFC on the Rhône population of E. nuttallii than on the Rhine population. No significant difference between the two populations was established with G. roeseli, but the level of DFC was high. This result demonstrates that the assessment of plant palatability should be carried out with several generalist herbivores belonging to various feeding groups (e.g. scrapers or shredders). Although the Rhône population of E. nuttallii had higher levels of phenols than the other populations, it was consistently consumed in greater quantities than E. canadensis. Neither the phenolic contents were not effective against these herbivores, nor the levels of phenolics too low to induce an efficient resistance. The higher DMC and the lower DFC of the two populations of E. canadensis suggest that this introduced plant has co-evolved with indigenous enemies in the introduced range.},

The fitness of the competing plants decreased with density. The fence-sitter shifted its root system from the pot with competition to that free of competition in proportion to the number of competitors. The fence-sitter apparently invested in each of its two roots so that the ratio between the roots was similar to the ratio between the resources in the pots. This result is analogous to the habitat-matching rule of the ideal free distribution of populations (Fretwell, 1972). We suggest that plants invest in each of their roots until the uptake rate per unit root biomass is equal for all roots.},

	abstract = {Models for the evolution of a mixture of cleistogamous (closed, autogamous) flowers and chasmogamous (open) flowers are described. The ‘basic’ model takes into account features associated with cleistogamous self-pollination, including the greater economy and certainty of cleistogamous fertilization and the inability of cleistogamous flowers to contribute pollen to the outcrossed pollen pool. Complete cleistogamous selfing is favoured when allocation to maternal function, fertilization rate, and viability of progeny are sufficiently greater for the cleistogamous component, and when the resources spent on ancillary structures in cleistogamous flowers, cleistogamous seed costs, and inbreeding depression are low. The result is discussed with respect to the cost of sex argument and relevant ecological data. Suggestions for the apparent rarity of cleistogamy are presented. The ‘complex habitat’ model extends the basic model to situations in which the success of reproduction by cleistogamy or chasmogamy varies according to the environment of the parent. In this situation, reproduction by both cleistogamy and chasomogamy is sometimes selected. A ‘near and far dispersal’ model addresses the question of the evolution of dual modes of dispersal, which occur in some cleistogamous and non-cleistogamous plants. A dual mode of dispersal may evolve if a narrowly dispersed seed type is more successful in establishing at the sites located within its dispersal range compared with a second, more widely dispersed seed type which experiences less sib competition. The prediction is discussed with respect to data from amphicarpic plants.},

	abstract = {Ecology Letters (2011) 14: 65–73 Abstract Intra- and interspecific plant–plant interactions are fundamental to patterns of community assembly and to the mixture effects observed in biodiversity studies. Although much research has been conducted at the species level, very little is understood about how genetic variation within and among interacting species may drive these processes. Using clones of both Solidago altissima and Solidago gigantea, we found that genotypic variation in a plant’s neighbours affected both above- and belowground plant traits, and that genotype by genotype interactions between neighbouring plants impacted associated pollinator communities. The traits for which focal plant genotypic variation explained the most variation varied by plant species, whereas neighbour genotypic variation explained the most variation in coarse root biomass. Our results provide new insight into genotypic and species diversity effects in plant–neighbour interactions, the extended consequences of diversity effects, and the potential for evolution in response to competitive or to facilitative plant–neighbour interactions.},

	abstract = {* Fundamental ecological research is both intrinsically interesting and provides the basic knowledge required to answer applied questions of importance to the management of the natural world. The 100th anniversary of the British Ecological Society in 2013 is an opportune moment to reflect on the current status of ecology as a science and look forward to high-light priorities for future work. * To do this, we identified 100 important questions of fundamental importance in pure ecology. We elicited questions from ecologists working across a wide range of systems and disciplines. The 754 questions submitted (listed in the online appendix) from 388 participants were narrowed down to the final 100 through a process of discussion, rewording and repeated rounds of voting. This was done during a two-day workshop and thereafter. * The questions reflect many of the important current conceptual and technical pre-occupations of ecology. For example, many questions concerned the dynamics of environmental change and complex ecosystem interactions, as well as the interaction between ecology and evolution. * The questions reveal a dynamic science with novel subfields emerging. For example, a group of questions was dedicated to disease and micro-organisms and another on human impacts and global change reflecting the emergence of new subdisciplines that would not have been foreseen a few decades ago. * The list also contained a number of questions that have perplexed ecologists for decades and are still seen as crucial to answer, such as the link between population dynamics and life-history evolution. * Synthesis. These 100 questions identified reflect the state of ecology today. Using them as an agenda for further research would lead to a substantial enhancement in understanding of the discipline, with practical relevance for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

There was a strong negative correlation between the presence of physical deterrents (e.g. area of fibres, number and length of spines) and the fluoroacetate concentration of each species.

	abstract = {We attempted to clarify how coastal lands temporarily exposed during the last glacial maximum (LGM) contributed to the northward colonisation of Kalopanax septemlobus (Thunb. ex Murray) Koidzumi during the postglacial period in the Japanese Archipelago. Distribution records in 30-arc-s pixels were related to bioclimate variables using the maximum entropy technique to model the ecological niche of this species. Bioclimatic conditions in the exposed coastal lands during the LGM were reconstructed based on simulated palaeoclimate and fine-resolution marine topography. Potential distribution ranges were then estimated under the climatic conditions during the LGM, mid-Holocene and the present. The ecological niche of this species was influenced mainly by the temperature component of the bioclimates, leading to northward range shift after the LGM as the climate warmed. On average, 26\% of the potential range of K. septemlobus during the LGM was located on the exposed seafloor. The northern edges of the species range on both sides of Honshu Island were estimated by up to several hundred kilometres farther north, when compared to the prediction assuming no sea level change. Application of ecological niche modelling provided new insight into the role of exposed seafloor as cryptic glacial refugia for this species, which has never been evidenced by fossil records. In a temperate island system characterised by long coastlines, the northern exposed seafloor would have been more important in terms of harbouring the putative source populations for northward directional colonisation during the postglacial period.},

Analysis examined two components of seed predation: seed encounter (the probability of at least one seed being removed) and seed exploitation (the proportion of seeds removed once encountered). Exclosure studies identified small mammals, particularly the woodmouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) as the principal post-dispersal seed predators and revealed a marked preference (almost four-fold difference in encounter) for seeds of Ulmus over Fraxinus. 3. For both Fraxinus and Ulmus, a linear regression model described the relationship between seed density and the number of seeds removed by rodents more successfully than non-linear models. These relationships were maintained whether the species were presented singly or together with neither the slopes of Fraxinus or Ulmus changing significantly. These results indicate that, over the range of seed densities used, rodents consumed a constant proportion of seeds irrespective of seed density or frequency. The high rates of exploitation for Ulmus seeds suggests the slope of the relationship primarily reflects rates of encounter, whereas for Fraxinus it is a result of both low encounter and exploitation. 4. Linear regression identified seed removal by rodents to be frequency-independent both over the woodland as a whole and within each of six micro-habitats. This appeared to be a result of the marked preference for Ulmus over Fraxinus which was not reversed even when Ulmus was rare. Frequency-dependent seed predation by rodents is predicted to be most likely when both prey have similar low palatabilities. 5. When encountered by rodents, patches of Ulmus seeds were exploited almost completely, irrespective of seed density or frequency which suggests rodents have the potential to cause local extinction of Ulmus seed populations. In contrast, the lower rates of encounter and exploitation of Fraxinus seeds implies ample opportunities for prey escape.},

Competition experiments on Arabidopsis thaliana were used to derive dynamic competition kernels for this species. * 2The experiments entailed growing target plants in isolation, and with single neighbours of different relative sizes, and at different distances. Growth was determined from repeated measures of the area occupied by each plant. Target plants with smaller neighbours, or with neighbours that were further away, grew to a larger size than targets with larger, or closer, neighbours. * 3Relative growth rate (RGR) of isolated plants was best described by the Gompertz equation, a standard plant growth equation that reduces RGR in proportion to the logarithm of plant size. * 4Competition kernels were constructed by modifying the Gompertz equation to include the competitive effect of a neighbour. Alternative kernels (including the zone of influence model), with and without a parameter of asymmetry of competition, were constructed from observed growth rates of target plants with neighbours over short time intervals. The kernels were evaluated based on their ability to predict the size of targets and neighbours over a much longer time period. * 5The kernel that best described growth overall was a simple function proportional to the logarithm of neighbour size, and decreasing with distance to the neighbour. The zone of influence model was best able to describe the effects of distance on competition, but was relatively unsuccessful when the two plants differed substantially in size. Including a parameter for asymmetry did not provide any notable improvements in predictive ability, and in many cases made the predictions worse.},

Hyperaccumulated Ni can defend plants from some herbivores but the defensive role of lesser Ni concentrations is little explored. We raised five species of Streptanthus (Brassicaceae) native to ultramafic soils, one of which (S. polygaloides) is a Ni hyperaccumulator whereas the others are simply Ni-tolerant, on Ni-amended and unamended green-house soils to create plants differing in Ni concentrations. On high-Ni soil, leaves of the hyperaccumulator contained 3800 μg Ni g−1 whereas leaves of non-hyperaccumulator species contained 41–64 μg Ni g−1. Plants of all species grown on low-Ni soils had {\textbackslash}textless 14 μg Ni g−1. Slugs (Limax maximus) were fed plant material in no-choice tests over a 50-day period and survival and mass changes were recorded. All slugs fed high-Ni leaves of the hyperaccumulator species died within 21 d. Slugs fed high-Ni leaves of the other species did not differ significantly in survival or mass change from those fed low-Ni leaves. In choice tests, slugs (Lehmannia valentiana) offered both high- and low-Ni S. polygaloides leaves did little damage to high-Ni leaves. We conclude that hyperacumulated Ni can defend S. polygaloides from slug herbivory via both toxicity and deterrence, but these defensive effects do not extend to Streptanthus species containing {\textbackslash}textless 70 μg Ni g−1.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/1942246},
	abstract = {Bumblebees of any one species in Maine forage for pollen and/or nectar from a large variety of morphologically diverse flowers, but individuals have limited foraging repertoires at any one time. Unspecialized individuals were sometimes unsuccessful in extracting nectar and/or pollen from highly rewarding flowers. In any one area with a variety of concurrently blooming plants, the bumblebees had apparent species preferences. Superimposed on the species preferences were individual preferences. Individuals had primary foraging specialties (their majors) and secondary specialities (their minors). Minors were often bridges to new majors. Queens in Maine necessarily have several successive majors during their lifetime since the blooming time of the plants they utilize are brief relative to their life-span as foragers. However, the blooming time of most plants available to Bombus fervidus workers are long relative to their lifetime. Switching was rarely observed in these bees, even in some individuals observed daily for up to 1 mo at the same foraging area containing other plant species in bloom that were highly attractive to other individuals of the same bumblebee species. On a per flower basis, those flowers producing the most food rewards generally had the largest number of bees majoring from them, and the food rewards available were roughly comparable between different kinds of flowers, regardless of their differences in rates of nectar production. Specializing was usually preceded by sampling a variety of rewarding as well as nonrewarding flowers. When the flowers from which bees were majoring in an area were experimentally removed many of the bees sampled flowers of other concurrently blooming plants, but they generally did not switch to flowers from which the food rewards were being depleted by specialists, unless these were experimentally fortified with syrup. Upon finding superior food rewards in enriched blossoms, they switched immediately. Flower-specificity is related to site-specificity. Many bees shared the same foraging area, but different individual bees at the same site utilized the flowers of different plant species. When the foraging area contained landmarks, the bees visited clumps of flowers in a sequence (foraging path) that was generally repeated several times on the same foraging trip when the foraging site was small. The foraging behavior of bumblebees is discussed from a comparative standpoint with other bees and in relation to food distribution and availability in the environment.},

Experimental evidence for the preference of Acentria for Myriophyllum over Elodea was obtained from small-scale, short-term laboratory experiments and from a tank experiment that represents a spatial and temporal scale intermediate between that of the small-container laboratory study and whole-lake observations. In laboratory no-choice feeding assays, Acentria exhibited higher feeding rates on Myriophyllum than on Elodea. In choice experiments, the larvae clearly preferred Myriophyllum over Elodea. Mesocosm tanks were set up with both Myriophyllum and Elodea planted in patches, and larval densities of 0, 75, 200 and 400 larvae m–2. After 3 weeks, biomass and shoot length of Myriophyllum was inversely correlated with larval density, but biomass of Elodea was unaffected. In this study, we explore whether a generalist macroinvertebrate herbivore such as Acentria, by preference for one macrophyte species over others, may affect the competitive interaction between two rooted plant species and subsequently may change the community composition within submersed macrophyte beds.},

	abstract = {Measuring pollinator performance has become increasingly important with emerging needs for risk assessment in conservation and sustainable agriculture that require multi-year and multi-site comparisons across studies. However, comparing pollinator performance across studies is difficult because of the diversity of concepts and disparate methods in use. Our review of the literature shows many unresolved ambiguities. Two different assessment concepts predominate: the first estimates stigmatic pollen deposition and the underlying pollinator behaviour parameters, while the second estimates the pollinator's contribution to plant reproductive success, for example in terms of seed set. Both concepts include a number of parameters combined in diverse ways and named under a diversity of synonyms and homonyms. However, these concepts are overlapping because pollen deposition success is the most frequently used proxy for assessing the pollinator's contribution to plant reproductive success. We analyse the diverse concepts and methods in the context of a new proposed conceptual framework with a modular approach based on pollen deposition, visit frequency, and contribution to seed set relative to the plant's maximum female reproductive potential. A system of equations is proposed to optimize the balance between idealised theoretical concepts and practical operational methods. Our framework permits comparisons over a range of floral phenotypes, and spatial and temporal scales, because scaling up is based on the same fundamental unit of analysis, the single visit.},

We found that ontogenetic trajectories occur in both resistance and tolerance but in opposite directions. The juvenile stage was more resistant but less tolerant than the reproductive stage. The ontogenetic switch from resistance to tolerance was consistent with the greater vulnerability of young plants to leaf damage and with the costs of resistance and tolerance found at each stage. We posit that the ontogenetic perspective presented here will be helpful in resolving the current debate on the existence and detection of a general resistance–tolerance tradeoff.},

They are produced in plants of the Brassicaceae and other related families. Biosynthesis of GSLs from precursor amino acids takes place in two subcellular compartments; amino acid biosynthesis and side chain elongation occur mainly in the chloroplast, whereas the following core structure synthesis takes place in the cytosol. Although the genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes of GSLs are well known in Arabidopsis thaliana, the transporter genes responsible for translocation of biosynthetic intermediates between the chloroplast and cytosol are as yet unidentified. In this study, we identified the bile acid:sodium symporter family protein 5 (BASS5) gene in Arabidopsis as a candidate transporter gene involved in methionine-derived GSL (Met-GSL) biosynthesis by means of transcriptome co-expression analysis. Knocking out BASS5 resulted in a decrease of Met-GSLs and concomitant increase of methionine. A transient assay using fluorescence fusion proteins indicated a chloroplastic localization of BASS5. These results supported the idea that BASS5 plays a role in translocation across the chloroplast membranes of the biosynthetic intermediates of Met-GSLs.},

	abstract = {An indoor choice experiment was conducted to assess the extent to which heifers offered two forages of different quality will attempt to consume the better quality forage when the weight/number of constraints applied on its harvesting increase. The experiment involved six Salers heifers, a leafy (L) and a coarse (C) hay, and two combined or single accessibility constraints. A physical constraint consisted of reducing the prehensibility of L by covering the trough with a steel grid of either 4 cm or 6 cm mesh size (L4 or L6 v. L infinity for no grid). A temporal constraint limited the daily access time to both hays to 4 v. 24 h. The hays were either offered alone or together over 2-week periods. Dry-matter intake and feeding time were recorded daily. As expected, the physical constraint (only L4 was efficient) made the heifers decrease their choice (proportion of feeding time or intake) for L regardless of access time, whereas the temporal constraint had no significant effect on choice. The heifers greatly modulated their intake rate of L even under strong physical constraint (L4), and then unexpectedly managed to ingest L faster than C. This emphasizes their motivation to keep ingesting the better quality forage, and underlines the difficulties in comparing diet choices with the optimal foraging theory predictions based on the relative values of a behavioural component subject to large variation, i.e. intake rate. In a very constraining situation (L4 and 4-h access), heifers made a choice that allowed them to increase their total daily digestible organic matter (DOM) intake compared with L4 or C offered alone because of an inverse relationship between feeding time and intake rate on L4. They did not however maximize their total daily DOM intake in a less constraining situation (L infinity or L6 and C, with 4-h access), since they did not consume L exclusively and showed a marked preference for a mixed diet.},

Preference data are compositional, since they describe the proportion of some resource, such as time or energy, which has been allocated to each option, and the sum of these proportions must be 1. The unit-sum constraint places a restriction on the types of analysis that are appropriate. The method of log ratios provides a transformation that leads to analyses in which the unit-sum constraint is automatically satisfied. This paper describes a form of log ratio analysis that allows estimation of the relative preferences for the options available and the influence on these preferences of the conditions under which the options are presented. The method is most suitable for application to data from controlled experiments in which options are presented in pairs, as equal availability of the choices can best be achieved and standard regression techniques can be used to fit the proposed models. The proposed analysis is demonstrated by a simple example in which the main difficulty of log ratio analysis, namely, unutilized options, is addressed and overcome.},

The hypothesis that deterrent compounds present in the leaves of red bay mediate its rejection by P. glaucus was evaluated in our study. Florida populations of P. glaucus did not oviposit on host leaves sprayed with the methanol extract of red bay foliage, although they accepted solvent-treated and untreated tulip tree leaves in 3 choice bioassays. Additionally, tulip tree leaves sprayed with methanolic extracts of red bay also deterred oviposition by P. glaucus females from Ohio, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, although these populations do not naturally encounter red bay. Clearly, deterrent compounds found within this non-host are the basis of its rejection by populations of P. glaucus and such recognition is fundamental to the species, not just a reflection of local adaptations.},

In this study, we investigate whether the oligophagous flea beetle, Altica fragariae Nakane (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), exhibits a positive preference–performance relationship, and whether oviposition preference develops over time. We tested the beetles using four sympatric plant species: Duchesnea indica (Andrews) Focke (the normal host plant), Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb. (a secondary host plant), and Potentilla chinensis Ser. and Sanguisorba officinalis L. (host plants of two related Altica species) (all Rosaceae). In no-choice experiments, both oviposition rate and offspring fitness parameters (eclosion rate, development time, and body mass) were highest on D. indica. Oviposition rate was much lower on P. chinensis than on A. pilosa, whereas offspring fitness parameters did not differ significantly between these two host plants. Offspring fitness were lowest for S. officinalis, and adult females refused to oviposit on this acceptable non-host in a no-choice situation. Repeated two-choice experiments showed that the proportion of oviposition on one of the novel host plants decreased significantly over time when the alternative host plant was D. indica. In repeated two-choice experiments using A. pilosa and P. chinensis, females mainly fed on A. pilosa but distributed their eggs equally over the two host plants, in accordance with the lack of difference in offspring fitness on those hosts. Together, these results showed that A. fragariae females develop a positive preference–performance relationship over time. We suggest that A. fragariae achieves this through adaptive learning of oviposition preference: not only does the female learn to discriminate among the host plants when there is a fitness difference for her offspring, but the female also fails to discriminate when there is no fitness difference.},

The included accessions increase the number of genera sampled over previous phylogenetic studies by four-fold. Using parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian methods, we reconstructed the phylogeny of the gene and used the Shimodaira–Hasegawa test (S–H test) to compare the phylogenetic results with the most recent tribal classification for the family. The resultant phylogeny allowed a critical assessment of variations in fruit morphology and seed anatomy, upon which the current classification is based. We also used the S–H test to examine the utility of trichome branching patterns for describing monophyletic groups in the ndhF phylogeny. Our phylogenetic results indicate that 97 of 114 ingroup accessions fall into one of 21 strongly supported clades. Some of these clades can themselves be grouped into strongly to moderately supported monophyletic groups. One of these lineages is a novel grouping overlooked in previous phylogenetic studies. Results comparing 30 different scenarios of evolution by the S–H test indicate that five of 12 tribes represented by two or more genera in the study are clearly polyphyletic, although a few tribes are not sampled well enough to establish para- or polyphyly. In addition, branched trichomes likely evolved independently several times in the Brassicaceae, although malpighiaceous and stellate trichomes may each have a single origin.},

Furthermore, we focused on the comparison of results on the growth responses of larvae obtained from two methods of insect rearing, the no-choice feeding trial performed in the laboratory or in situ in open-top chambers. On the whole, both primary and secondary metabolites in the leaves of the two tree species were significantly affected by main effects of time (sampling date), CO2 and species. Elevated CO2 significantly increased the C : N ratio and concentrations of the soluble sugar, starch, total nonstructural carbohydrates, total phenolics and condensed tannins, but significantly decreased the concentration of nitrogen. Higher contents of total phenolics and condensed tannins were detected in the frass of larvae reared in elevated CO2 treatments. Overall, the growth of gypsy moth larvae were significantly inhibited by elevated CO2 and CO2-induced changes in leaf quality. Our study did not indicate the two methods of insect rearing could influence the direction of effects of elevated CO2 on the growth of individual insects; however, the magnitude of negative effects of elevated CO2 on larval growth did differ between the two insect rearing methods, and it seems that the response magnitude was also mediated by larval age and host plant species.},

These decisions play a pivotal role in insect–plant interactions, placing host preference under strong selection and contributing to the diversity of phytophagous insects as one of the first traits to adapt to new hosts.2. This study presents a test of whether extreme isolation and exposure to different host plants can produce intra-specific divergence in oviposition preference in alpine insects. Geographic variation should impose selection to fine-tune host plant ranking and specificity to the plants normally encountered, to avoid wasting time during the very limited reproductive season experienced at high altitudes.3. Beetles from five populations of Oreina elongata differing in host availability were offered three natural hosts: Cirsium spinosissimum, Adenostyles alliariae, and Adenostyles glabra. A novel application of a continuation ratio model (logistic regression) was made to sequential no-choice experiments, combined with quasi-likelihood analysis of multiple-choice experiments.4. The results show little geographic variation in host plant choice: all populations strongly preferred Cirsium in multiple-choice trials, and in no-choice experiments laid around 47\% of their remaining eggs during each stage, almost regardless of the host present.5. Enemy-free space seems to explain the preference for Cirsium, but isolation and exposure to different plants has clearly not caused local adaptation in host plant ranking or specificity. Reasons for this conservatism despite divergence in other characteristics are discussed.},

Some plants are densely covered with short, non-glandular trichomes, whereas other plants in the same populations possess glandular trichomes that excrete a sticky exudate. The hypothesis that glandular trichomes enhance resistance to all small insect herbivores is evaluated.2. Field censuses in four southern Californian D. wrightii plant populations revealed that glandular plants are indeed resistant to whitefly spp. (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae). Whiteflies are almost exclusively found on non-glandular plants. In contrast, Tupiocoris notatus (Distant) (Heteroptera: Miridae), another sap-sucking herbivore of similar body size, is found predominantly on plants with glandular trichomes.3. Laboratory experiments showed that whiteflies are unable to colonize glandular D. wrightii phenotypes. After the whitefly adults had landed on the leaves of these plants, they were trapped in the exudate and died.4. Tupiocoris notatus adults, on the other hand, laid significantly more eggs on glandular plants. The presence of the exudate was shown to be the cue that determined their choice of glandular plants.5. In no-choice experiments, T. notatus nymphs reared on glandular plants had significantly higher survival rates and had shorter developmental periods than those raised on non-glandular plants. This, combined with the higher oviposition rates, resulted in higher T. notatus population growth rates on glandular plants than on non-glandular plants.6. Glandular trichomes are not therefore a universal protection against small herbivores. Differences in distribution over the two plant types within the natural herbivore guild on D. wrightii may, among other selection pressures, contribute to the maintenance of the observed trichome polymorphism.},

The two lineages of the nuclear genome are generally consistent with those of the chloroplast genome detected in a previous study, with several discrepancies between the two genomes. Within-population genetic diversity was generally very high (average H E = 0.839), but decreased in a clinal fashion from southwest to northeast, largely among populations of the Japan Sea lineage.

	abstract = {Floral display and reward production may affect the attractiveness of a plant to a range of interacting animals including pollinators, herbivores, and vectors of pathogenic fungi. The optimal floral phenotype should therefore depend on the relative importance of selection exerted by both mutualistic and antagonistic animals. The perennial, rosette herb Primula farinosa is polymorphic for scape length. Natural populations may include both plants with flowers displayed well above the ground (the long-scaped morph) and those with flowers positioned very close to the ground (the short-scaped morph). In this study, we conducted a field experiment to examine how the relative fitness of the two scape morphs is affected by interactions with pollinators and fruit predators in two different microhabitats (high and low vegetation). As predicted based on the difference in floral display, supplemental hand-pollination showed that fruit initiation was more strongly pollen-limited in the short-scaped than in the long-scaped morph, and that this difference was significantly larger in high than in low vegetation. Moreover, plants with a short scape experienced lower levels of fruit predation than plants with a long scape. Among open-pollinated controls, there was no significant difference in seed output between the two scape morphs. However, among plants receiving supplemental hand-pollination, short-scaped plants produced significantly more seeds than long-scaped plants. The results suggest that the positive and negative effects of a prominent floral display (increased pollination and seed predation, respectively) balance in the study population, but also that the short-scaped morph would have an advantage at higher pollination intensities. Spatial and temporal variation in pollinator activity and seed predation should result in associated variation in the relative fecundity of the two scape morphs.},

	abstract = {Recent experiments showed that plants start releasing a specific set of volatile chemicals after being attacked by phytophagous arthropods and that these chemicals are used by predators (including parasitoids) to find phytophages. In this way plants exploit the natural enemies as part of their battery of defence. The evolution of this defence strategy is not a simple, self-explanatory process, for two reasons. Firstly, the odour cannot be produced without some costs and even when released in trace quantities its volatile nature causes the benefit to be of short duration so that overall costs may be considerable. Secondly, plants that do not produce odour in response to attack by phytophages, save energy to be spent in other ways of improving fitness and they may gain the same advantage of attracting predators with higher chances when settled close to an odour-producing plant. Based on these realistic and general features a Nicholson-Bailey type model of tritrophic interactions is constructed. Analysis of the model showed that under a wide range of conditions plant populations are expected to be polymorphic, when the costs of producing odour may be offset by saving the energy for other fitness-related purposes and by the probability of settlement close to an odour producing plant. These predictions have far-reaching consequences for experiments on breeding for plant resistance and for olfactometer studies of searching behaviour of predators.},

	abstract = {Cynoglossum officinale is a Eurasian plant that has become an invasive weed of rangelands in the United States and Canada. It is a herbaceous, monocarpic, short-lived perennial. Since there are no satisfactory means of control of houndstongue, a biological control project was initiated in 1988. The first species introduced for the control of houndstongue is a root-mining weevil, Mogulones cruciger, which was first released in Canada in 1997. The flea beetle Longitarsus quadriguttatus is another below-ground herbivore species considered for the biological control of C. officinale. Previous host-specificity investigations with 49 European test-plant species demonstrated that larval development of the flea beetle is limited largely to plant species within the tribe Cynoglosseae in Boraginaceae. However, investigations neither included any native North American Boraginaceae species nor examined results of earlier tests for plant species that were susceptible to attack by the flea beetle. Therefore, additional host-range investigations were conducted between 1994 and 1996. Different no-choice and choice tests were conducted with 7 plant species that showed susceptibility to attack in previous tests and 5 native North American plant species. Experiments were carried out under laboratory and open-field conditions. L. quadriguttatus was host specific in these tests. Two European test-plant species outside the genus Cynoglossum and 2 native North American Cynoglossum species supported complete development of the flea beetle to some extent, but in all cases the test plants were significantly less suitable hosts than houndstongue. The remaining 5 European and 3 native North American test-plant species did not support development and/or survival of L. quadriguttatus. The introduction of L. quadriguttatus into Canada was approved in 1998.},

	abstract = {Abstract.— The ability of populations to undergo adaptive evolution depends on the presence of quantitative genetic variation for ecologically important traits. Although molecular measures are widely used as surrogates for quantitative genetic variation, there is controversy about the strength of the relationship between the two. To resolve this issue, we carried out a meta-analysis based on 71 datasets. The mean correlation between molecular and quantitative measures of genetic variation was weak (r = 0.217). Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between the two measures for life-history traits (r =−0.11) or for the quantitative measure generally considered as the best indicator of adaptive potential, heritability (r =−0.08). Consequently, molecular measures of genetic diversity have only a very limited ability to predict quantitative genetic variability. When information about a population's short-term evolutionary potential or estimates of local adaptation and population divergence are required, quantitative genetic variation should be measured directly.},

	abstract = {Although variation in the effectiveness of the plant-mycorrhizal association has been demonstrated among plant species and among crop cultivars, the level of specificity of the plant-mycorrhizal association in natural populations and, in particular, its effect on intraspecific plant interactions have not been explored. To examine the influence of the specificity of the plant-mycorrhizal association on intraspecific interactions in Allium vineale, we surrounded target plants with either genetically identical neighbors, neighbors from the same population, or neighbors from a different population, and planted them in pots either with or without a soil fungi community. Overall, the presence of a soil fungal community was beneficial for plant growth, and thus the soil fungal community effects in this system are dominated by the mutualistic effect of mycorrhizae. In addition, both the target plant and neighbor plants had a relatively greater benefit from the mycorrhizal association if the neighbors were genetically identical or from the same population than if the neighbors came from a different population. Thus, there is specificity in the interaction between A. vineale plants and the soil fungal community at the population level, and this specificity favors intraspecific interactions among plants from the same population. In addition, in the presence of the soil fungal community, the variance in plant size within a pot was greater among neighbors from a different population. Therefore the growth advantage for plants growing with neighbors from the same population was not due to pre-emption of resources by individual plants. This finding provides indirect evidence to support the hypothesis that plants from the same population were able to share a more efficient hyphal network.},

	abstract = {Changes in host acceptance is an important factor in the host specialization of phytophagous insects, and knowledge of the genetic organization of this behaviour is necessary in order to understand how host shifts occur. Here we describe the inheritance of adult host acceptance (oviposition) in three closely related species of Yponomeuta Latreille (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae), and their interspecific hybrids. Yponomeuta cagnagellus (Hübner), a specialist on Euonymus europaeus L. (Celastraceae), Y. malinellus Zeller, a specialist on Malus spp. (Rosaceae), and Y. padellus (L.), oligophagous on a number of Rosaceae, were tested for their acceptance of parental hosts in choice tests. Acceptance of E. europaeus is semi-dominant in hybrids of Y. cagnagellus×Y. padellus, and in hybrids of Y. cagnagellus×Y. malinellus. The dominance of this acceptance was confirmed in oviposition tests with backcross hybrids: backcross hybrids F1 × Y. cagnagellus oviposited mainly on E. europaeus and F1 × Y. padellus still deposited more than half of their egg masses on E. europaeus. Reciprocal hybrids did not differ in their host acceptance, indicating that the trait is autosomal. We further studied the effect of larval food on adult host acceptance (‘Hopkins host selection principle’) in split full-sib F1 families. Larval diet influenced oviposition only in one of two hybrid crosses. The F1 hybrid of Y. padellus× Y. cagnagellus, reared on Prunus spinosa L., deposited a significantly lower percentage of egg masses on E. europaeus compared to their full-sib sisters fed with E. europaeus. We did not find this in the reciprocal cross. However, still more than half of the egg masses are deposited on E. europaeus by hybrids that have no experience on this host. We conclude that the semi-dominant character of acceptance of E. europaeus and a tendency of Rosaceae-feeding Yponomeuta to deposit egg masses on this host may have created the opportunity for the host shift of the predecessor of Y. cagnagellus from Rosaceae to the Celastraceae. This shift may have been further facilitated by a weak tendency of adults to oviposit on their larval food source.},

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05604.001 ‘Genetic variation’ describes the naturally occurring differences in DNA sequences that are found among individuals of the same species. These genetic differences arise from random mutations and may be passed on to their offspring. Some of these mutations may improve the ability of an individual to survive and reproduce—known as fitness—and are likely to become more common in the population. Other mutations may reduce an individual's fitness and are likely to be lost. However, it is believed that most of the mutations will have no effect on the fitness of individuals. It is not known why many of these ‘neutral’ genetic differences are maintained in populations. Some researchers have proposed that they are kept by chance and that there is no direct advantage to the population of keeping them unless these neutral mutations later become beneficial. However, other researchers think that the genetic variation itself may improve the fitness of the population by allowing it to quickly adapt to changes in the environment. Arabidopsis thaliana is a small plant that lives in many different environments and has high levels of genetic variation in many of its physical traits. One of these traits is the production of molecules called glucosinolates, which help the plants to defend against herbivores and infection by microbes. Previous studies have suggested that variation in the genes that make glucosinolates may improve the fitness of A. thaliana populations. To test this idea, Kerwin et al. carried out a field trial using A. thaliana plants that were genetically identical except for some of the genes involved in the production of glucosinolates. Kerwin et al. grew the plants in several different environments over several years. The field trial shows that variation in these genes affected the fitness of the plants in each of the different environments. However, the fitness benefit depended on the environment, and no single gene variant provided the best fitness across all environments, or over all the years of the trial. Kerwin et al.'s findings suggest that changes in the environment may contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation in the genes that make glucosinolates. This raises the questions of how many other genes in plants (or other species such as humans) have genetic variation that contributes to fitness across varied environments; and how can this link be tested in natural settings.

	abstract = {The Lepidoptera represent one of the most successful radiations of plant-feeding insects, which predominantly took place within angiosperms beginning in the Cretaceous period. Angiosperm colonization is thought to underlie the evolutionary success of the Lepidoptera because angiosperms provide an enormous range of niches for ecological speciation to take place. By contrast, the basal lepidopteran lineage, Micropterigidae, remained unassociated with angiosperms since Jurassic times but nevertheless achieved a modest diversity in the Japanese Archipelago. We explored the causes and processes of diversification of the Japanese micropterigid moths by performing molecular phylogenetic analysis and extensive ecological surveying. Phylogenetic analysis recovered a monophyletic group of approximately 25 East Asian endemic species that feed exclusively on the liverwort Conocephalum conicum, suggesting that niche shifts hardly played a role in their diversification. Consistent with the low flying ability of micropterigid moths, the distributions of the Conocephalum specialists are each localized and allopatric, indicating that speciation by geographical isolation has been the major process shaping the diversity of Japanese Micropterigidae. To our knowledge, this is the largest radiation of herbivorous insects that does not accompany any apparent niche differentiation. We suggest that the significance of non-ecological speciation during the diversification of the Lepidoptera is commonly underestimated.},

	abstract = {Clonal plants grow by the production of semi-autonomous modules (ramets), and form complex branching structures which may provide communication/resource flow channels between the units. These characteristic features have made clonal plants a challenging subject for spatial modelling. We review the advance of ideas and new directions in theoretical research since the last review (Oborny and Cain, 1997). We place clonal growth models into a general framework of spatial population dynamic models, comparing individual ramets of a clone with individuals in a non-clonal population. We discuss three specificities of clonal spreading: (1) ramets can be physiologically integrated through the network of branching structures; (2) formation of new ramets occurs by the growth of these branching structures which can be directional, following architectural rules; and (3) formation of new ramets can be adjusted to the environment by phenotypic plasticity. We review methods by which these traits have been implemented into models. We summarize model predictions, for the spatial structure and fitness of clonal plants, and link these predictions with existing empirical data. Emphasis is given to the contributions that theoretical studies could provide for experimental studies in the field. We emphasize the following recent major developments: (i) a much better understanding of emergent consequences of various clonal growth rules over broad spatial and temporal scales has been reached. (ii) Links have been found to other complex systems. For example, a key problem of integration vs. splitting of connecting structures has been shown to be closely related to a problem in percolation theory. (iii) Interactions between physiological integration, architectural growth and plastic responses have been demonstrated; research on these interactions has generally shown a large degree of contingency in the effects of these traits. Finally, we outline some areas for future research.},

	abstract = {This paper extends existing models of frequency-dependent diet selection by considering the optimal diet selection of a predator feeding upon prey populations which can be depleted but are also capable of renewal (e.g. immigration, growth, or reproduction). This model and existing models which include prey depletion, predict partial-preference and a generic diet preference for the commonest prey types (apostatic selection). Unlike previous diet selection models, it is found that the optimal diet selection of an individual predator can be to favour the rarest prey type (anti-apostatic selection) when encounter rates are high, even if the individual prey do not differ in their nutritional value. Studies have demonstrated that predators generally show apostatic selection, even when all prey have the same nutritional value. Anti-apostatic selection has also been observed when prey are crowded, and therefore at high density, consistent with the idea of high encounter rates. This anti-apostatic diet selection has previously been proposed as evidence for the use of prey search images by a predator, or variation in individual prey preference. In this paper it is suggested that prey renewal is a further factor, often confounded in experiments, which could favour anti-apostatic selection.},

	abstract = {Species closely related to model organisms present the opportunity to efficiently apply molecular and functional tools developed by a large research community to taxa with different ecological and evolutionary histories. We complied 42 microsatellite loci that amplify under common conditions in four closely related Arabidopsis: A. thaliana; A. halleri; A. lyrata ssp. lyrata; and A. lyrata ssp. petraea, as well as in one more distantly related crucifer; Arabis drummondii. Variation at these loci is amenable to a diversity of applications including population genetics, phylogeographical analyses, mapping of inter and intraspecific crosses, and recombination mapping. Our analysis of microsatellite variation illustrates significant differences in population genetic parameters among three Arabidopsis species. A population of A. thaliana, an inbreeding annual plant associated with disturbed habitats, was highly monomorphic (P = 8\% percent polymorphic loci) and only 0.2\% heterozygous for 648 locus-by-individual combinations. A population of the self-incompatible perennial herb, A. halleri, was more genetically variable (P = 71\%) and had an excess of heterozygosity that may reflect a recent population bottleneck associated with human-mediated founder events. A population of the self-incompatible perennial herb, A. lyrata ssp. petraea, was even more genetically variable (P = 86\%) and appeared to be at mutation-drift equilibrium. Population structure estimated from neutrally evolving loci provides an empirical expectation against which hypotheses of adaptive evolution at functional loci can be tested.},

	abstract = {The degree of adaptation of herbivorous insects to their local flora is an important component of the evolutionary processes that lead to host plant specialization in insects. In this study we investigated geographic variations in the oviposition preference of the leaf beetle Oreina elongata Suffrian (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Chrysolini) in relation to differences in host plant specialization, in the field. We focused on the mechanisms of host choice and asked whether potential differences among populations are due to variations in host plant ranking and/or host plant specificity. We performed a combination of simultaneous choice and sequential no-choice experiments with two of the major host plants of the beetle [Cirsium spinosissimum (L.) and Adenostyles alliariae (Gouan) (Asteraceae)]. The results suggested that spatial variation in host plant specialization has resulted in differences between populations in some aspects of the oviposition choice of O. elongata, while other aspects seem unaffected. We found no variation in host plant ranking among populations, as estimated in simultaneous choice tests. In contrast, the sequential no-choice test indicated that host plant specificity was lower in a population that never encountered the highest ranked plant in the field. This finding agreed with our expectations, and we discuss our results in relation to the commonly used hierarchical threshold model. The results suggested that the mechanism for the differences in specificity is the variation among populations in the general motivation to oviposit, rather than quantitative differences in relative preference for the two hosts. We stress that it is essential to establish which of the two mechanisms is most important, as it will affect the probability of evolutionary change in host plant ranking.},

The average number of alleles per locus was four and the average genetic diversity index was 0.43. Divergence between length variants was investigated at the nucleotide level. Several observations emerge from the sequence data: (1) for most loci, length polymorphism results only from variations in the number of trinucleotide repeats; (2) for a few others, some variability was noted in the flanking sequences; (3) for compound and interrupted loci containing two arrays of trinucleotide repeats, length variations preferentially affect the longest one. Five of the Arabidopsis thaliana accessions were clearly composed of two sublines. In 2 other accessions, some heterozygous individual plants, probably resulting from recent outcrosses, were found. A phylogenetic tree constructed on the basis of trinucleotide microsatellite allelic diversity shows that genetic relationships among the accessions are not correlated with their geographic origin.},

	abstract = {Morphological plasticity in clonal plants has received wide attention because localized plastic changes in spacer length, branching intensity and branching angle may enable clonal plants to place ramets selectively in the more favourable microhabitats within a heterogeneous environment. These responses have been interpreted in terms of foraging behaviour. Studies of morphological plasticity in clonal plants are usually carried out with one or two genotypes of a species, or with material of unknown genetic origin. Based on the concept of phenotypic plasticity, it is argued that such studies do not reveal whether plasticity in a population can be modified by natural selection. In addition, responses are often evaluated at two environmental conditions only, which may underestimate plasticity. Hence, our information on the ecological and evolutionary significance of morphological plasticity in clonal plants is still very incomplete. Two examples are given to show that stolon internode and rhizome lengths may vary considerably within an individual plant. Only a minor part of this variation may be plastic, i.e. the variation is hardly changed by the environmental conditions to which the plants are subjected. Hence, non-plastic variation in clonal morphology may exceed the degree of morphological plasticity. The non-plastic variation seems to originate from species-specific patterns of stolon and rhizome development. Marked non-plastic variation may obscure the effects of morphological plasticity on the placement pattern of ramets in the field, suggesting that plasticity in clonal morphology may not be very effective in terms of foraging for favourable patches. Possible reasons for the low levels of plasticity of clonal spacers are discussed.},

We quantified phenological variation and synchrony of populations of an invasive Eurasian flower head weevil, Rhinocyllus conicus, that consumes florets, ovules, and seeds of developing flower heads of a native North American thistle, Cirsium canescens, in Sand Hills prairie in Nebraska, USA. Variation in timing of adult activity among weevil populations was larger than variation in timing of flower head development among C. canescens populations, and it drove the observed variation in the phenological synchrony between weevil and host plant populations. Furthermore, the degree of phenological synchrony between populations was significant in explaining variation in weevil egg load on the newly acquired host plant. Because population growth of C. canescens is limited by predispersal seed losses to floral herbivores, variation in the synchrony of herbivore and plant flowering will affect the density of the plant population. These results provide strong quantitative support for the hypothesis that the synchrony of insect activity with plant resources can determine the magnitude of impact of floral herbivores on their host plant populations.},

A Bayesian approach-based clustering program indicated that the marker data contained not only one panmictic population, but consisted of seven clusters, and that each original sample site seems to consist of a distinct subpopulation. A coalescent-based simulation approach shows recurrent gene flow between subpopulations. Relative high FST values indicated a clear subpopulation differentiation. However, amova analysis and UPGMA-dendrogram did not suggest any hierarchical regional structuring among the subpopulations. There was no correlation between geographical and genetic distances among the subpopulations, nor any correlation between the subpopulation census size and amount of genetic variation. Estimates of gene flow suggested a low level of gene flow between the subpopulations, and the assignment tests proposed a few long-distance bidirectional dispersal events between the subpopulations. No apparent difference was found in within-subpopulation genetic diversity among upper, middle and lower regions along the river. Relative high amounts of linkage disequilibrium at subpopulation level indicated recent population bottlenecks or admixture, and at metapopulation levels a high subpopulation turnover rate. The overall pattern of genetic variation within and between subpopulations also suggested a ‘classical’ metapopulation structure of the species suggested by the ecological surveys.},

Additionally, this mean time is greater near the center of the habitat than near the ends. In the distant past, lineages that have not undergone coalescence are more likely to have been at opposite ends of the population range, whereas coalescent events in the distant past are biased toward the center. All of these effects are more pronounced when gene flow is more limited. The pattern of pairwise nucleotide differences predicted by the model is compared to data collected from sardine populations.

	abstract = {Aim We compare the influence of contemporary geography and historical influences on butterfly diversity for islands in the Aegean archipelago. Location The Aegean archipelago (Greece) and two islands (Cyprus and Megisti) in the Levantine Sea. Methods Thirty-one islands were examined. Data are taken from own surveys (Coutsis and Olivier) and from the literature. Stepwise multiple regression is used to determine relationships between species richness, frequency, rarity and endemicity against potential geographical predictors. Stepwise logit regression is used to determine geographical predictors of species incidence on islands. Inter-island and inter-species associations have been examined using multivariate ordination and clustering techniques. Results The Aegean butterfly fauna is characterized by decreasing diversity and rarity, and increasing homogeneity, from the periphery to the present geographical centre of the archipelago (Cyclades). Diversity and rarity are shown to relate closely to species richness, and species richness, in turn, is largely explained by contemporary geography, particularly the degree of isolation from the nearest mainland sources of Greece or Turkey, and island dimensions. Islands towards the centre of the archipelago are characterized by a group of mobile species (n ≥ 20 species) with extensive ranges across Europe; species that would have recolonized Santorini (Thira) following the VI6 eruption there c. 1630 bc. Endemic components, indicative of autochthonous evolutionary events, are few (5\% of species are endemic) compared to known sedentary organisms (molluscs and isopods), but exceed those for more mobile animals (i.e. birds); their distribution is mainly confined to large isolated islands along the Aegean arc (i.e. Kriti) and in the Dodecanese group. Main conclusions Contemporary geography, i.e. processes currently operating in ecological time, dominates butterfly diversity gradients (species richness, frequency, rarity and incidence) in the archipelago. Two reasons are suggested to account for the lack of endemism and the pattern of decreasing diversity into the Cyclades. First, relict butterfly elements may have become extinct on all but a few larger islands, particularly from environmental changes since the Neolithic (fire and overgrazing). Second, colonization from the continental landmasses is ongoing with more mobile species transferring even to the most isolated islands.},

	abstract = {Large herbivores must select food from a wide variety of plant parts, species, and strains. These differ in nutritional value (protein, carbohydrate, etc.), toughness, spinosity, etc. Even greater differences are found in types and concentrations of secondary compounds. Every plant produces its own set of secondary chemical compounds, which to a great extent are unique to it or its species. Ingestion of natural concentrations of these compounds can lead to either death or severe physiological impairment. The ubiquitous nature of these compounds would make herbivory impossible unless animals had mechanisms for degrading and excreting them. An animal displaying no obvious symptoms of poisoning is not free of the problem of ridding itself of toxic compounds; if it is eating plants, it almost certainly has this problem. Herbivores are capable of detoxifying and eliminating secondary compounds. Limitations of these mechanisms force mammalian herbivores to consume a variety of plant foods at any one time, to treat new foods with caution, to ingest small amounts on the first encounter, and to sample food continuously. Selection of foods is based on learning in response to adverse internal physiological effects, and herbivores probably cannot predict these from the smell or taste of new foods. Herbivores prefer to eat familiar foods and can seek out and consume foods that rectify specific nutritional deficiencies induced by detoxification. They should prefer to feed on foods that contain small amounts of secondary compounds, and their body size and searching strategies should be adapted to optimize the number of types of foods available with respect to the total amount of food that can be eaten and will be present in the future. Natural selection can increase the efficiency of degrading particular secondary compounds. Specialist herbivores, like koala and mountain viscacha, are expected where a large amount of several related toxic foods is present in a year-round supply. However, few large herbivores are specialized on such a restricted range of foods.},

	abstract = {Ecologists have long observed that consumers can maintain species diversity in communities of their prey. Many theories of how consumers mediate diversity invoke a tradeoff between species’ competitive ability and their ability to withstand predation. Under this constraint, the best competitors are also most susceptible to consumers, preventing them from excluding other species. However, empirical evidence for competition–defense tradeoffs is limited and, as such, the mechanisms by which consumers regulate diversity remain uncertain. We performed a meta-analysis of 36 studies to evaluate the prevalence of the competition–defense tradeoff and its role in maintaining diversity in plant communities. We quantified species’ responses to experimental resource addition and consumer removal as estimates of competitive ability and resistance to consumers, respectively. With this analysis, we found mixed empirical evidence for a competition–defense tradeoff; in fact, competitive ability tended to be weakly positively correlated with defense overall. However, when present, negative relationships between competitive ability and defense influenced species diversity in the manner predicted by theory. In the minority of communities for which a tradeoff was detected, species evenness was higher, and resource addition and consumer removal reduced diversity. Our analysis reframes the commonly held notion that consumers structure plant communities through a competition–defense tradeoff. Such a tradeoff can maintain diversity when present, but negative correlations between competitive ability and defense were less common than is often assumed. In this respect, this study supports an emerging theoretical paradigm in which predation interacts with competition to both enhance and reduce species diversity.},

	abstract = {Abstract Population cycles have fascinated ecologists since the early nineteenth century, and the dynamics of insect populations have been central to understanding the intrinsic and extrinsic biological processes responsible for these cycles. We analyzed an extraordinary long-term data set (every 5 days for 48 years) of a tea tortrix moth (Adoxophyes honmai) that exhibits two dominant cycles: an annual cycle with a conspicuous pattern of four or five single-generation cycles superimposed on it. General theory offers several candidate mechanisms for generation cycles. To evaluate these, we construct and parameterize a series of temperature-dependent, stage-structured models that include intraspecific competition, parasitism, mate-finding Allee effects, and adult senescence, all in the context of a seasonal environment. By comparing the observed dynamics with predictions from the models, we find that even weak larval competition in the presence of seasonal temperature forcing predicts the two cycles accurately. None of the other mechanisms predicts the dynamics. Detailed dissection of the results shows that a short reproductive life span and differential winter mortality among stages are the additional life-cycle characteristics that permit the sustained cycles. Our general modeling approach is applicable to a wide range of organisms with temperature-dependent life histories and is likely to prove particularly useful in temperate systems where insect pest outbreaks are both density and temperature dependent.},

	abstract = {The causes and consequences of flower constancy have been the focus of many studies, but almost all have examined the foraging behavior of bumblebees, honeybees, or butterflies. We test whether constancy occurs in an overlooked group of pollinators, the syrphid flies. Foraging sequences of wild flies of two species, Episyrphus balteatus and Syrphus ribesii were examined when visiting flowers in seminatural plant communities and in artificial arrays of two color morphs of Lobularia maritima planted at a range of frequencies. Both species exhibited marked floral constancy when foraging in the mixed-plant community. Because all groups of pollinating insect so far examined exhibit constancy at least under some circumstances, we suggest that this is the predominant strategy used by pollinators and that there is probably a common explanation. Neither syrphid species exhibited constancy to different color morphs within a plant species, in contrast to previously published studies of Hymenoptera foraging among polymorphic flowers, which all describe positive frequency-dependent selection. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. We argue that constancy in these syrphids is unlikely to result from learning constraints on handling ability, currently the most widely accepted explanation for flower constancy, because they forage primarily for pollen which is easily located inmost flowers they visit.},

	abstract = {Induced responses to herbivores are common and well documented in plants. It has been hypothesized that the evolutionary ecology of induced responses can be understood by studying benefits of induction in the presence of herbivores and costs of induction in the absence of herbivores. Phenotypic benefits and costs of induction would indicate that such plasticity in defense could be adaptive (i.e., that phenotypes matched to their environmental conditions have higher relative fitness than unmatched phenotypes). However, few studies to date have investigated the benefits and costs of induction in the same system. In this study, induced responses of Lepidium virginicum to herbivory reduced feeding by generalist noctuid caterpillars in choice and no-choice experiments. Induced plant responses to herbivory were correlated with an increase in the number of trichomes per leaf and an increase in the diversity of the putatively defensive chemical compounds, glucosinolates, present in the foliage of damaged plants compared to undamaged controls. Induction did not affect the feeding behavior of the larvae of the specialist butterfly, Pieris rapae. In field experiments, induction reduced natural colonization of plants by aphids compared to both unmanipulated controls and controls that were damaged (but not induced) by clipping a leaf from the plant using a pair of scissors. Induced plants were more likely to survive in the field than clipped plants, a result that suggests a net fitness benefit of induction when leaf tissue removal was controlled. In experiments conducted in the absence of herbivores, damage induced responses did not reduce the root or shoot biomass of plants grown at low density. At high plant density, induction was associated with both reduced root biomass and increased aboveground growth, suggesting that induction may cause an allocation shift, rather than a loss of total biomass. Induced responses of plants satisfy a necessary component of adaptive plasticity because plants in variable herbivore environments maximize relative fitness by adjusting their defensive phenotype.},

We show that the two approaches are functionally identical and that either can be used to make statistical inferences about values at internal nodes of a phylogenetic tree (hypothetical ancestors), to estimate relationships between characters, and to predict values for unmeasured species. Regression equations derived from independent contrasts can be placed back onto the original data space, including computation of both confidence intervals and prediction intervals for new observations. Predictions for unmeasured species (including extinct forms) can be made increasingly accurate and precise as the specificity of their placement on a phylogenetic tree increases, which can greatly increase statistical power to detect, for example, deviation of a single species from an allometric prediction. We reexamine published data for basal metabolic rates (BMR) of birds and show that conventional and phylogenetic allometric equations differ significantly. In new results, we show that, as compared with nonpasserines, passerines exhibit a lower rate of evolution in both body mass and mass‐corrected BMR; passerines also have significantly smaller body masses than their sister clade. These differences may justify separate, clade‐specific allometric equations for prediction of avian basal metabolic rates.},

	abstract = {1. Most plant species rely upon multiple lines of defence that develop or change functions with leaf age. To date, the effects of leaf age on multiple defence traits have been insufficiently elucidated. For Mallotus japonicus (Euphorbiaceae), we report a shift from direct to indirect defence against herbivory. That shift occurs gradually during leaf ageing.2. First, the densities of trichomes and pellucid dots, the numbers of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) and pearl bodies, and the number of ants on leaves of M. japonicus were examined in the field at weekly intervals. Secondly, herbivore species and the degree of herbivory were examined. Thirdly, the effects of ants on herbivore exclusion were investigated experimentally in the field. Finally, to confirm the effectiveness of trichomes and pellucid dots for defence against two herbivore species [the adult flea beetle, Aphthona strigosa (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), and the inchworm, Ascotis selenaria (Lepidoptera: Geometridae)], both young and middle-aged leaves were tested using laboratory bioassay.3. On newly emerged leaves, densities of trichomes and pellucid dots were extremely high, but they decreased rapidly with leaf age. The respective quantities of EFNs that were actually secreting nectar, the pearl bodies, and the ants on middle-aged leaves were greater than those on leaves of other ages. On M. japonicus, we found 11 herbivorous insects, among which Ap. strigosa and As. selenaria were the principal herbivores.4. The damaged leaf areas of ant-excluded plants were much larger than those of control plants. Most herbivory was attributable to As. selenaria. Laboratory bioassay revealed that against Ap. strigosa and small As. selenaria larvae, trichomes and pellucid dots in young leaves functioned well, although those in middle-aged leaves did not.5. Synthesis. Young M. japonicus leaves are defended against herbivores through the use of direct defence traits such as trichomes and pellucid dots. However, the plant uses indirect defence traits for middle-aged leaves. This shift from direct defence to indirect defence with leaf ageing supports the ‘optimal defence theory’: plants have evolved multiple defence traits to maximize their fitness.},

	abstract = {The feeding preferences and performance of a freshwater macrophyte-feeding chrysomelid beetle (Galerucella nymphaeae) were assessed in laboratory experiments. Populations of Galerucella had a relatively narrow diet breadth, preferring species of Nuphar, Polygonum, and in 1 case Brasenia, while largely ignoring the remaining macrophytes offered in assays. However,because of interpopulation variation in host preferences, the species G. nymphaeae should be considered polyphagous. Distant populations from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Indiana, and North Carolina collected from Nuphar spp all readily consumed Nuphar spp. and Polygonum spp, but beetles from a site in south Michigan collected from P. amphibium or from Brasenia schreberi treated Nuphar as a low-preference host. The performance of Galerucella in no-choice assays was clearly related to the behavioral preferences of the larvae: larvae performed well on 3 macrophyte species that they willingly consumed, but performed poorly when they refused to consume alternative host plants and presumably starved to death. It is unknown if the starved beetles could have performed well physiologically if they had eaten alternative hosts. Performance was also related to the quality of host plant, given that beetles collected from Nuphar luteum or N. advena reached a larger adult mass on N. luteum than on N. advena. The feeding preferences of Galerucella were largely non-plastic within a single generation, although there were sometimes behavioral differences among clutchmates raised on different host plants. Morphometric and preliminary allozyme data suggest the North American populations used in this paper are conspecific, but they probably represent a different species than European G. nymphaeae. The intraspecific variation of our North American G. nymphaeae in host preferences and performance suggests that at least 2 different ecotypes occur in North America.},

Coadaptation and coevolution occur because correlational selection (CS) and correlated evolution couple many traits. CS arises from causal interactions between traits expressed in two or more interactors, which invariably involve different traits (signalers-receivers). Thus, the causes of CS are due to FDS acting on trait interactions. Negative FDS, a rare advantage, is often coupled to positive FDS generating complex dynamics and FD cycles. Neural mechanisms of learning and perception create analogous routes by which traits are reinforced in cognitive and perceptual systems of interactors, substituting for positive FDS. FDS across all levels of biological organization is thus best understood as proximate causes that link interactors and shape genetic correlations within and among interactors on long timescales, or cognitive trait correlations within interactors on short timescales. We find rock-paper-scissors dynamics are common in nature.},

However, communities can be structured by a combination of both local and regional processes and to date, few community genetics studies have examined whether the effects of instraspecific genetic variation are consistent across levels of diversity. In this study, we ask whether host-plant genetic variation structures communities of arthropod inquilines within distinct habitat patches – rosette leaf galls on tall goldenrod (Solidago altissima). We found that genetic variation determined inquiline diversity at both local and regional spatial scales, but that trophic-level responses varied independently of one another. This result suggests that herbivores and predators likely respond to heritable plant traits at different spatial scales. Together, our results show that incorporating spatial scale is essential for predicting the effects of genetically variable traits on different trophic levels and levels of diversity within the communities that depend on host plants.},

Nematode treatments also increased cabbage yields as compared to the control and azadirachtin treatments alone. Azadirachtin alone was not effective to prevent damage by P. striolata, but it could enhance the control effect of S. carpocapsae shortly after application.

Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. * The presentation of ‘variance explained’ (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. * One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). * Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. * This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.},

This study provides a survey of the Great Lakes region of Canada to determine the extent of this mating system variation and how outcrossing rates are related to current population density, geographical distribution, and genetic diversity. Based on variation at microsatellite markers (progeny arrays to estimate multilocus outcrossing rates and population samples to estimate diversity measures) and controlled greenhouse pollinations, populations can be divided into two groups: (i) group A, consisting of individuals capable of setting selfed seed (including autogamous fruit set in the absence of pollinators), showing depressed outcrossing rates (Tm = 0.2–0.6), heterozygosity (HO = 0.02–0.06) and genetic diversity (HE = 0.08–0.10); and (ii) group B, consisting of individuals that are predominantly self-incompatible (Tm {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.8), require pollinators for seeds set, and showing higher levels of heterozygosity (HO = 0.13–0.31) and diversity (HE = 0.19–0.410). Current population density is not related to the shift in mating system but does vary with latitude. Restricted gene flow among populations was evident among all but two populations (FST = 0.11–0.8). Group A populations were more differentiated from one another (FST = 0.78) than they were from group B populations (FST = 0.59), with 41\% of the variation partitioned within populations, 47\% between populations, and 12\% between groups. No significant relationship was found between genetic and geographical distance.

	abstract = {Plants are exposed to a suite of herbivorous attackers that often arrive sequentially. Herbivory affects interactions between the host plants and subsequently attacking herbivores. Moreover, plants may respond to herbivory by emitting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that attract carnivorous natural enemies of the herbivores. However, information borne by VOCs is ubiquitous and may attract carnivores, such as parasitoids, that differ in their effectiveness at releasing the plant from its herbivorous attackers. Furthermore, the development of parasitoids within their herbivorous hosts, attacking a given host plant, may influence the elicitation of defensive reactions in the host plant. This may, in turn, affect the behavior of subsequent herbivores attacking the host plant. Here, we show that the species identity of a parasitoid had a more significant effect on defense responses of Brassica oleracea plants than the species identity of the herbivorous hosts of the parasitoids. Consequently, B. oleracea plants that were damaged by caterpillars (Pieris spp.) parasitized by different parasitoid species varied in the degree to which diamondback moths (Plutella xylostella) selected the plants for oviposition. Attracting parasitoids in general benefitted the plants by reducing diamondback moth colonization. However, the species of parasitoid that parasitized the herbivore significantly affected the magnitude of this benefit by its species-specific effect on herbivore–plant interactions mediated by caterpillar regurgitant. Our findings show that information-mediated indirect defense may lead to unpredictable consequences for plants when considering trait-mediated effects of parasitized caterpillars on the host plant and their consequences because of community-wide responses to induced plants.},

	abstract = {The spatial patterns in the mean and variance of a quantitative character that result from the interaction of spatially varying, optimizing selection and gene flow are considered. The model analyzed is an extension of those of Kimura (1965) and Lande (1976) for the distribution of a quantitative character maintained in a population by independent mutations. For weak selection, it is shown that there is only a small effect of gene flow on the variance of the character and that the mean value changes on a length scale that is large compared to the average dispersal distance. As in models of clines in allele frequencies, it is possible to define a “characteristic length” in terms of the average dispersal distance and strength of selection. The characteristic length is the smallest length scale environmental change to which the mean value of the character can significantly respond. It is also shown that, for weak selection, an asymmetry in dispersal can result in a significant shift in location of a cline. By considering an infinite linear cline in optimal values, it is shown that gene flow can increase the variance only when there is sufficient mixing in each generation of individuals from locations with different means. A model of selection in different niches is also considered. There is an increase in variance due to the effective weakening of the intensity of selection because of the differences in optimal values in different niches. The implications of the different models for maintenance of genetic polymorphism are discussed. Under some conditions gene flow can produce a significant increase in heterozygosity. It is also argued that spatial variation in selection on a polygenic character can be much more effective in increasing heterozygosity than temporal variation because of the potentially greater increase in phenotypic variance. The difference between some of the results for polygenic characters from those of similar models of one and two locus systems is accounted for by the fact that for normally distributed polygenic characters, changes in the variance are effectively decoupled from changes in the mean.},

In the choice experiment, newly moulted final instar larvae were provided with one of three protein-biased foods (PB-food: p35:c7, p28:c5.6 or p21:c4.2) and one of three equal protein–carbohydrate ratio foods (ER-food: p21:c21, p16.8:c16.8 or p12.6:c12.6). On five of the nine treatments, caterpillars independently regulated protein and carbohydrate intake to a mixture of 57 and 43\%, respectively. However, when the concentration of the ER-food decreased and that of the paired PB-food increased, caterpillars progressively abandoned regulation and ate more of the PB-food. Despite these regulatory differences, performance (survivorship, growth and development) was similar across all nine treatments. In the no-choice experiment, caterpillars were given one of five foods (p35:c7, p28:c14, p21:c21, p14:c28 and p7:c35). Results indicated that caterpillars moved to a point in protein–carbohydrate space that was consistent with the Equal Distance Rule of compromise, a pattern previously predicted for generalist feeders. The insects on the two extreme foods, p35:c7 and p7:c35, showed reduced pupal mass and longer development, respectively. There was also strong evidence for post-ingestive regulation of nutrient utilisation, notably for protein.},

	abstract = {1. Induced resistance is now widely accepted as a potent and widespread ecological force although several pieces of the story remain very poorly known. Theory predicts that induced defences should be favoured in variable environments especially when plants can use cues to reliably predict future conditions; however, this idea has not been seriously evaluated for plants. 2. Theory also predicts that plastic, induced defences should be favoured over permanent, constitutive defences if defences are costly and not always needed. This hypothesis has received considerable attention and limited support; resource allocation costs have been difficult to detect although ecological costs of defence may be more common. Recently, priming has emerged as a mechanism that may further reduce costs. Primed plants do not immediately produce the gene products associated with induced resistance but later respond more rapidly and strongly to severe or repeated attacks. It remains to be determined how common priming is. 3. Much of what we know about induced resistance is from the herbivore’s point of view. Induced resistance will be beneficial from the plant’s point of view if herbivores avoid induced plants, but the behavioural responses of herbivores to induced plant variation are still poorly studied. 4. Recent progress in understanding the detailed spatial and temporal extent of induced resistance has improved our appreciation of the phenomenon. Although some induced responses are systemic throughout entire plant individuals, many others have been found to be localized to damaged tissues. Plant vascular architecture and transpiration rates greatly constrain the distribution of vascular cues. Some plants rely on volatile cues that are active over relatively short distances and may be subject to eavesdropping by other plants, herbivores, and carnivores. Similarly, the temporal duration of induced responses may have important consequences on effectiveness although limited information is available concerning lag times before induction and relaxation times following induction. 5. Limited spatial and temporal scales of induced responses make plants more variable from the herbivore’s point of view. Recent work suggests that plant heterogeneity may be difficult for herbivores to cope with although this hypothesis awaits further empirical testing.},

We tested whether the competitive responses of eight species varied with fertility and disturbance in an old field. We also tested whether the competitive effects of vegetation varied with fertility and disturbance in an old field. We also tested whether the competitive effects of vegetation varied with fertility and disturbance. Plots received one of four combinations of nitrogen (added or not) and disturbance (tilled or not) in each of five years. There were 10 replicates of each treatment. In the fifth summer, transplants of eight species comprising annual and perennial forbs and grasses were grown in all four combinations of the N and disturbance treatments. Transplants were grown in subplots with all neighbors, with only roots of neighbors, or with no neighbors. Transplant roots and shoots were harvested after one summer and individual growth rates were determined. Growth rate varied significantly with the interaction among species, competition, and N, suggesting that species differed in their competitive responses and that these differences varied with N availability. Comparisons among competition treatments at each level of N showed six distinct responses in the eight species examined. The competitive effect of neighboring vegetation shifted from roots to shoots as N increased, but decreased in disturbed plots. The total effect of competition increased significantly with neighbor mass in 4 of the 32 examined (eight species in four combinations of N and disturbance). All four cases involved annuals in annual neighborhoods. The results for eight species confirmed earlier single-species diverged in their responses to competition as soil N availability varied.},

Pseudenargia ulicis Staud and Noctua janthe Borkhausen are natural herbivores of the species in southeastern Spain, whereas Spodoptera littoralis Boisduval is a model species frequently used to address the antifeedant role of secondary compounds. Discrimination between control and coumarin-coated D. laureola leaves was investigated by short-term choice experiments. We found species-specific behavioural responses to the treatment: P. ulicis preferred the control leaves, whereas S. littoralis did not discriminate between leaf treatments, although it clearly avoided coumarin when incorporated into an artificial diet, and N. janthe preferred the coumarin-coated leaves. Furthermore, N. janthe larvae reduced consumption when the proportion of treated leaves ingested increased and consumption of S. littoralis larvae was also reduced in coumarin-containing diet under no-choice conditions. Our results highlight that different herbivore species feeding simultaneously on the same host plant respond differently to a single chemical defence compound, likely constraining a directional response of the plant to selection.},

	abstract = {Mimicry has evolved in a wide range of organisms and encompasses diverse tactics for defence, foraging, pollination and social parasitism. Here, I report an extraordinary case of egg mimicry by a fungus, whereby the fungus gains competitor-free habitat in termite nests. Brown fungal balls, called ‘termite balls’, are frequently found in egg piles of Reticulitermes termites. Phylogenetic analysis illustrated that termite-ball fungi isolated from different hosts (Reticulitermes speratus, Reticulitermes flavipes and Reticulitermes virginicus) were all very similar, with no significant molecular differences among host species or geographical locations. I found no significant effect of termite balls on egg survivorship. The termite-ball fungus rarely kills termite eggs in natural colonies. Even a termite species (Reticulitermes okinawanus) with no natural association with the fungus tended termite balls along with its eggs when it was experimentally provided with termite balls. Dummy-egg bioassays using glass beads showed that both morphological and chemical camouflage were necessary to induce tending by termites. Termites almost exclusively tended termite balls with diameters that exactly matched their egg size. Moreover, scanning electron microscopic observations revealed sophisticated mimicry of the smooth surface texture of eggs. These results provide clear evidence that this interaction is beneficial only for the fungus, i.e. termite balls parasitically mimic termite eggs.},

	abstract = {Abstract Many organisms exhibit parental optimism, producing more of the initial stages of offspring (e.g., eggs, embryos) than they can usually mature. For plants, parental optimism may be linked to the risk of seed production being limited by pollen receipt (pollen limitation). Here we elaborate a stochastic model of pollen limitation developed by Haig and Westoby (1988) and Burd (2008) and link it with published data on the magnitudes of prepollination costs versus postpollination costs of seed production in 80 plant species. We demonstrate that parental optimism should be expected when prepollination costs of seed production are small relative to postpollination costs. This was observed for most (62 of 80) of the plant taxa surveyed. Under parental optimism, plants overinvest in securing fertilized ovules, and consequently pollen limitation is predicted to be uncommon. However, for a sizable minority of plant species (18 of 80), prepollination costs approach or exceed postpollination costs. For these species, parental pessimism is instead optimal. Parents initiate fewer zygotes than they can usually mature, and pollen limitation is predicted to be severe. Because the relative magnitudes of prepollination and postpollination costs vary by more than 1,000-fold across plant taxa, parental outlook (optimism vs. pessimism) and levels of pollen limitation are predicted to vary widely.},

Digested crude protein was unaffected by increased consumption of preferred foods, but declined when hares consumed nonpreferred foods. Rate of weight loss in hares increased with increasing consumption of nonpreferred twigs. Hares did not compensate for low protein or low energy content by eating more twigs. Weight changes were correlated with the energy content of the food and its digestibility, whereas consumption was correlated with phenol and protein content. If hares can increase consumption of preferred foods, they may simultaneously meet both their energy and protein requirements. If they are obliged to increase consumption of nonpreferred foods, then protein requirements may never be met due to the effects of secondary compounds. During periods of limited food availability, snowshoe hares should select a mixed diet that may include small quantities of poor-quality food items, regardless of preference, allowing them time to find good-quality foods.},

	abstract = {1. Although secondary metabolites are recognized as fundamental to the defence of plants against insect and mammalian herbivores, their relative importance compared to other potential defensive plant traits (e.g. physical resistance, gross morphology, life-history, primary chemistry and physiology) are not well understood.2. We conducted a meta-analysis to answer the question: What types of genetically variable plant traits most strongly predict resistance against herbivores? We performed a comprehensive literature search and obtained 499 separate measurements of the strength of covariation (measured as genetic correlations) between plant traits and herbivore susceptibility – these were extracted from 72 studies involving 19 plant families.3. Surprisingly, we found no overall association between the concentrations of secondary metabolites and herbivore susceptibility – plant traits other than secondary metabolites most strongly predicted herbivore susceptibility. Specifically, genetic variation in life-history traits (e.g. flowering time, growth rate) consistently exhibited the strongest genetic correlations with susceptibility. Genetic variation in gross morphological traits (e.g. no. branches, plant size) and physical resistance traits (e.g. latex, trichomes) were also frequently correlated with variation in herbivore susceptibility, but these relationships depended on attributes of the herbivores (e.g. feeding guild) and plants (e.g. longevity).4. These results call into question the conventional wisdom that secondary metabolites are the most important anti-herbivore defence of plants. We propose the hypothesis that herbivores select most strongly on genetic variation in life-history, morphological and physical resistance traits, but the greater pleiotropic effects of genes controlling these traits impose strong constraints on their evolution. Meanwhile, secondary metabolites could have evolved to be important defensive mechanisms not because they have the largest effect on herbivores, but because the constraints on their evolution are the weakest.},

Both parapatry and extinction can occur in the presence of asymmetrical population parameters, depending on the dispersal characteristics of the interacting species. Parapatry is predicted at small migration constants, whereas extinction will occur at large ones. Species extinction may result from reproductive competition (satyrization) alone. Parapatry will be stable in relatively sessile organisms interacting through satyrs even in the absence of competition for common resources. The outcome of interactions between two species thus results from both trophic and reproductive competition.},

We compared pollinators in a population of Asclepias incarnata (Apocynaceae) for several components of pollinator effectiveness over two flowering seasons to evaluate their importance to plant reproduction. Insects of the order Hymenoptera predominate in A. incarnata pollination, but there appears to be no specialization for pollination within this order. Pollinators varied significantly in nearly every component of effectiveness that we measured, including pollen load, removal and deposition of pollen, pollination efficiency (deposition/removal), flower-handling time, and potential for geitonogamy (fractional pollen deposition). The visitation rate of pollinators also varied significantly between years and through time within years. Pollination success and percentage fruit-set of unmanipulated plants in the population also varied significantly between years, and pollination success varied among sample times within years. Most components of effectiveness were weakly correlated, suggesting that the contributions of visitor species toward pollination varied among effectiveness components. Mean flower-handling time, however, was strongly correlated with several components, including pollen removal and deposition, pollination efficiency, and fractional pollen deposition. These findings highlight the significance of pollination variability for plant reproduction and suggest that time-dependent foraging behaviors may play an important role in determining pollinator effectiveness.},

To explore the possibility that various side chain confer divergent biological activities to individual GS, we have investigated the performance of the specialist pest beetle, Phaedon cochleariae (F.) on Arabidopsis thaliana L. mutants and Columbia wild-type (WT) which differ in the main group of GS. Plant lines of A. thaliana altered for the expression of MAM3, because of the introduction of an overexpression construct of MAM3 (mam3+) or containing double knockouts of CYP79B2 and CYP79B3 (cyp79B2-/cyp79B3-) were used for the study in comparison to the WT. A. thaliana genotypes differed in their GS profiles. The highest GS content was present in the WT followed by mam3+ and cyp79B2-/cyp79B3-. A modified aliphatic GS content was detected for the mam3+ as compared to the WT lines. Furthermore, indolyl GS were completely absent in cyp79B2-/cyp79B3-. The percentage weight increase of larvae raised on each of the three plant genotypes was significant different. Larval performance was poorest on plants of cyp79B2-/cyp79B3- and best on WT, but there was no significant difference found in percentage weight increase on mam3+ and WT. There was no correlation between the weight increase of the larvae on genotypes and induced levels of aliphatic, indolyl, and total GS. However, the poor performance of beetle larvae on cyp79B2-/cy79B3- compared to WT and mam3+ might be explained by comparable high aliphatic GS levels of this mutant, a different induction of secondary metabolites, and the absence of indolyl GS. Basic knowledge about the relationship of GS structures and their insect pests may help in further resistance breeding of crucifer crops.},

	abstract = {A recently developed integrative framework proposes that the vulnerability of a species to environmental change depends on the species' exposure and sensitivity to environmental change, its resilience to perturbations and its potential to adapt to change. These vulnerability criteria require behavioural, physiological and genetic data. With this information in hand, biologists can predict organisms most at risk from environmental change. Biologists and managers can then target organisms and habitats most at risk. Unfortunately, the required data (e.g. optimal physiological temperatures) are rarely available. Here, we evaluate the reliability of potential proxies (e.g. critical temperatures) that are often available for some groups. Several proxies for ectotherms are promising, but analogous ones for endotherms are lacking. We also develop a simple graphical model of how behavioural thermoregulation, acclimation and adaptation may interact to influence vulnerability over time. After considering this model together with the proxies available for physiological sensitivity to climate change, we conclude that ectotherms sharing vulnerability traits seem concentrated in lowland tropical forests. Their vulnerability may be exacerbated by negative biotic interactions. Whether tropical forest (or other) species can adapt to warming environments is unclear, as genetic and selective data are scant. Nevertheless, the prospects for tropical forest ectotherms appear grim.},

	abstract = {Abstract Discrete phenotypic variation often involves threshold expression of a trait with polygenic inheritance. How such discrete polyphenisms evolve starting from continuously varying phenotypes has received little theoretical attention. We model the evolution of sigmoid norms of reaction in response to variation in an underlying trait or in a continuous environment to identify conditions for the evolution of discontinuity. For traits with expression depending on a randomly varying underlying factor, such as developmental noise, polyphenism is unstable under constant phenotypic selection for two selective peaks, and reaction norm evolution results in a phenotypic distribution concentrated at only one peak. But with frequency-dependent selection between two adaptive peaks, a steep threshold maintaining polyphenism can evolve. For inducible plastic traits with expression conditioned on an environmental variable that also affects phenotypic selection, the steepness of the evolved reaction norm depends both on the differentiation of the environment in time or space and on its predictability between development and selection. Together with recent measurements of genetic variance of threshold steepness, these predictions suggest that quasi-discrete phenotypic variation may often evolve from continuous norms of reactions rather than being an intrinsic property of development.},

	abstract = {The number of sires fertilizing a given dam is a key parameter of the mating system in species with spatially restricted offspring dispersal, since genetic relatedness among maternal sibs determines the intensity of sib competition. In flowering plants, the extent of multiple paternity is determined by factors such as floral biology, properties of the pollen vector, selfing rate, spatial organization of the population, and genetic compatibility between neighbours. To assess the extent of multiple paternity and identify ecological factors involved, we performed a detailed study of mating patterns in a small population of a self-incompatible clonal herb, Arabidopsis halleri. We mapped and genotyped 364 individuals and 256 of their offspring at 12 microsatellite loci and jointly analysed the level of multiple paternity, pollen and seed dispersal, and spatial genetic structure. We found very low levels of correlated paternity among sibs (Pfull-sib = 3.8\%) indicating high multiple paternity. Our estimate of the outcrossing rate was 98.7\%, suggesting functional self-incompatibility. The pollen dispersal distribution was significantly restricted (mean effective pollen dispersal distance: 4.42 m) but long-distance successful pollination occurred and immigrating pollen was at most 10\% of all pollination events. Patterns of genetic structure indicated little extent of clonal reproduction, and a low but significant spatial genetic structure typical for a self-incompatible species. Overall, in spite of restricted pollen dispersal, the multiple paternity in this self-incompatible species was very high, a result that we interpret as a consequence of high plant density and high pollinator service in this population.},

Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountaintop species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming.

	abstract = {Associational resistance occurs when herbivore damage to a focal plant is reduced by the presence of other plant species. Neighboring plants can reduce herbivore damage (1) by their effects on the predator community, (2) by reducing the ability of herbivores to find their host plants, and (3) by reducing the time herbivores remain on their host plants. We examined how the presence of the aromatic low shrub Myrica gale and of predatory lady beetles affected herbivore damage and reproductive output in a population of the perennial herb Lythrum salicaria in northern Sweden. An observational study showed that L. salicaria growing in Myrica thickets were less damaged by herbivores, had a lower abundance of the monophagous, leaf-feeding, chrysomelid beetle Galerucella calmariensis, and had higher flower and seed production than L. salicaria outside Myrica thickets. To test whether these differences could be explained by (a) differences in some aspect of plant quality, or (b) differences in predator abundance, we placed potted L. salicaria within and outside Myrica thickets. To determine whether differences in the abundance of G. calmariensis were primarily the result of different rates of colonization or emigration, we marked adult beetles and placed them on a second set of potted plants in the two microhabitats. The results show that differences in herbivore abundance, plant damage, and reproductive output between potted L. salicaria placed within and outside Myrica thickets were in the same direction and of the same magnitude as those observed for naturally occurring plants, indicating that the observed patterns were not an effect of differences in the chemical composition of the host plant. Moreover, we found no support for the hypothesis that a higher abundance of insect predators could explain the lower abundance of G. calmariensis on L. salicaria in Myrica thickets. On the contrary, lady beetles (Coccinella quinqempunctata and Coccinella septempunctata) were observed on a greater proportion of the plants placed outside the Myrica thickets. The monitoring of marked beetles indicated that differences in the abundance of G. calmariensis were the result of a markedly higher colonization rate and a somewhat lower emigration rate from L. salicaria outside Myrica thickets. Outside the Myrica thickets, the survival of G. calmariensis and the magnitude of herbivore damage were lower, and fruit and seed output were higher on plants with observations of lady beetles than on plants without lady beetles. The results indicate that the abundance of the specialist herbivore G. calmariensis, and the herbivore damage and reproductive output of its host plant, L. salicaria, are affected both by the presence of the nonhost Myrica and by predation from lady beetles. We suggest that the most likely mechanism causing decreased feeding on L. salicaria growing in Myrica thickets is that Myrica affects the ability of G. calmariensis to find its host, either through visual or olfactory interference.},

	abstract = {Author Summary A principal interest in biology is to understand how natural genetic variation translates into phenotypic variation. A key component of this connection is how the genetic variation interacts with other sources of variation, such as environment (G×E), development (G×D), or other genetic loci (G×G or epistasis). To analyze the molecular underpinnings of these quantitative genetics interaction terms, we investigated the genetic architecture of an adaptive trait, glucosinolate activation, in Arabidopsis thaliana during the development of what is considered a static mature rosette. Variation in glucosinolate activation was principally controlled by epistatic and G×D interactions. Epistatic interactions identified both Mendelian epistasis, where regulatory loci controlled enzymatic loci, and quantitative interactions between regulatory loci. G×D appeared to involve master regulatory loci as determined by trans-eQTL hotspot analysis. Finally, two common glucosinolate activation QTLs appear to have evolved via gene loss and sub-functionalization following quadruplication of an ancestral genomic fragment, potentially by two whole-genome duplications. Thus, genomic duplication events may facilitate the formation of quantitative genetic variation. This study provides insights into the molecular basis of the link between genetic and phenotypic variation in a potentially adaptive trait.},

However, the majority of studies on endophyte–grass symbioses have been conducted on economically important, agricultural species—particularly tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne)—raising the hypothesis that strong benefits are the product of artificial selection. We examined whether fungal endophytes found in natural populations of native grass species deterred insect herbivores. By testing several native grass–endophyte symbiota, we examined phylogenetic signals in the effects of endophytes on insects and compared the relative importance of herbivore and symbiotum identity in the outcome of the interactions. Preference was assessed using three herbivore species [Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera), Schistocerca americana (Orthoptera), Rhopalosiphum padi (Hemiptera)] and ten native symbiota, which spanned seven grass genera. We also assessed herbivore performance in a no choice experiment for five native symbiota against S. frugiperda. We compared greenhouse and laboratory trials with natural levels of herbivory measured in experimental field populations. In all cases, we included the agronomic grass species, L. arundinaceum, to compare with results from the native grasses. Both in the field and in experimental trials, herbivores showed a significant preference for endophyte-free plant material for the majority of native grasses, with up to three times lower herbivory for endophyte-symbiotic plants; however, the degree of response depended on the identity of the herbivore species. Endophyte presence also significantly reduced performance of S. frugiperda for the majority of grass species. In contrast, the endophyte in L. arundinaceum had few significant anti-herbivore effects, except for a reduction in herbivory at one of two field sites. Our results demonstrate that the mechanisms by which native symbionts deter herbivores are at least as potent as those in model agricultural systems, despite the absence of artificial selection.},

	abstract = {Traits that confer plant resistance to some herbivore species but increase plant susceptibility to other herbivore species are said to carry an "ecological cost" of herbivore resistance. The native perennial, Datura wrightii, is dimorphic for leaf trichome type, and the production of glandular trichomes carries a potential ecological cost over the production of nonglandular trichomes. Glandular trichomes provide resistance to at least six herbivore species, but they also confer susceptibility to Tupiocoris notatus, an abundant mirid bug with special adaptations to glandular trichomes. We estimated herbivore-specific damage to plants of each trichome type and measured plant seed production, a component of fitness, in a common garden over three years. Plant seed production increased with the size and persistence of leaf canopies and occasionally declined with increasing damage caused by some of the defoliating insects. Plant seed production was never reduced by T. notatus damage, however. Even though the ecological cost of glandular trichome production was not apparent in D. wrightii, the trait still was not beneficial. The fitness of plants with glandular trichomes never exceeded that of plants with nonglandular trichomes despite variation in both the composition of the herbivore community and the total level of damage inflicted by herbivores over three years of study. The persistence of the allele coding for glandular trichomes cannot be explained solely on the basis of the herbivore resistance that those trichomes provide.},

We performed choice feeding tests to examine whether A. flavokansiensis adults have a fixed feeding preference for bundleflower. In choice tests, beetles ate similar amounts of bundleflower and honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos). In addition, we measured fecundity and longevity of adults in no-choice tests to determine if adults were adapted solely to bundleflower. In no-choice tests, fecundity and longevity were no different for adults feeding on bundleflower and honey locust. We next examined the influence of host plant on the attractiveness of beetle eggs to ants. In northeastern Kansas, Crematogaster lineolata ants are attracted to A. flavokansiensis eggs and carry them into their nests where the larvae hatch and apparently reside as inquilines. C. lineolata exhibited a strong preference for eggs from female A. flavokansiensis that fed exclusively on bundleflower compared to eggs from females that fed exclusively on honey locust. Local populations of A. flavokansiensis in northeastern Kansas may specialize on bundleflower to increase the chances of their eggs being transported by C. lineolata ants into their nests. C. lineolata nests may serve as a predator-free and sheltered environment in which A. flavokansiensis eggs undergo embryogenesis.},

Alkaloids, like sparteine, lupanine, quinidine and atropine are avoided in no-choice feeding experiments only when they are present in concentrations above 1 mg/g food pellet. Alkaloids (sparteine, lupanine, cytisine, quinidine, atropine, senecionine, eserine, and harmaline) are toxic to Arion lusitanicus when injected. LD50 values are 10 to 20 fold higher than in vertebrates indicating that slugs have a high tolerance towards food toxins. The tolerance is higher in young animals than in adult slugs. Injected alkaloids are rapidly detoxified within 72 h. Tolerance and detoxification can be induced by feeding slugs on non-lethal doses of lupin alkaloids. Using isolated microsomal preparations from the digestive gland, active detoxification was observed in vitro. Evidence is presented that cytochrome p450 plays an important role in detoxification of the applied alkaloids. A powerful and inducible detoxification systems appears to be the main mechanism that allows slugs to feed on plants rich in secondary metabolites (when no other food is available), that are usually avoided by other herbivores.},

	abstract = {We studied the response of female Callosobruchus chinensis to chemical cues emitted by cowpea seeds at different stages of bruchid infestation (uninfested, egg carrying, L1-, and L4-infested). Olfactory attractiveness was determined in Y-tube olfactometer assays by testing individual seed categories against either clean air or uninfested seeds. Oviposition preferences between uninfested and infested seeds were determined in petri-dish choice-experiments. The olfactometer assays revealed that weevils discriminate between seeds containing different stages of developing bruchids on the basis of olfactory cues. While odors from uninfested and egg-carrying seeds acted as attractants, odors from L1- and L4-infested seeds failed to induce a positive response by the bruchids. When given a choice between uninfested and infested seeds in the olfactometer, weevils preferred uninfested seeds over L1- and L4-infested seeds, but failed to distinguish between uninfested and egg-carrying seeds. In the oviposition experiment as well, bruchids showed a distinct preference for uninfested seeds when offered in combination with L1- and L4-infested seeds. This experiment further showed a reduced acceptance of egg carrying seeds. Our results indicate that C. chinensis females use chemical information during both host searching and host acceptance. Volatiles from uninfested or egg carrying seeds act as attractants, while deterrence increases as development of bruchid immature stages progresses.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems have a limited buffering capacity of multiple ecosystem functions against biodiversity loss (i.e. low multifunctional redundancy). We developed a novel theoretical approach to evaluate multifunctional redundancy in a microbial community using the microbial genome database (MBGD) for comparative analysis. In order to fully implement functional information, we defined orthologue richness in a community, each of which is a functionally conservative evolutionary unit in genomes, as an index of community multifunctionality (MF). We constructed a graph of expected orthologue richness in a community (MF) as a function of species richness (SR), fit the power function to SR (i.e. MF = cSRa), and interpreted the higher exponent a as the lower multifunctional redundancy. Through a microcosm experiment, we confirmed that MF defined by orthologue richness could predict the actual multiple functions. We simulated random and non-random community assemblages using full genomic data of 478 prokaryotic species in the MBGD, and determined that the exponent in microbial communities ranged from 0.55 to 0.75. This exponent range provided a quantitative estimate that a 6.6–8.9\% loss limit in SR occurred in a microbial community for an MF reduction no greater than 5\%, suggesting a non-negligible initial loss effect of microbial diversity on MF.},

	abstract = {Colour-marking polymorphism is widely distributed among cryptic species. To account for the adaptive significance of such polymorphisms, several hypotheses have been proposed to date. Although these hypotheses argue over the degree of camouflage effects of marking morphs (and the interactions between morphs and their microhabitat backgrounds), as far as we know, most empirical evidence has been provided under unnatural conditions (i.e., using artificial prey). Tetrix japonica, a pygmy grasshopper, is highly polymorphic in colour-markings and occurs in both sand and grass microhabitats. Even within a microhabitat, T. japonica is highly polymorphic. Using humans as dummy predators and printed photographs in which various morphs of grasshoppers were placed against different backgrounds, we addressed three questions to test the neutral, background heterogeneity, and differential crypsis hypotheses in four marking-type morphs: 1) do the morphs differ in the degree of crypsis in each microhabitat, 2) are different morphs most cryptic in specific backgrounds of the microhabitats, and 3) does the morph frequency reflect the degree of crypsis? The degree of camouflage differed among the four morphs; therefore, the neutral hypothesis was rejected. Furthermore, the order of camouflage advantage among morphs differed depending on the two types of backgrounds (sand and grass), although the grass background consistently provided greater camouflage effects. Thus, based on our results, we could not reject the background heterogeneity hypothesis. Under field conditions, the more cryptic morphs comprised a minority of the population. Overall, our results demonstrate that the different morphs were not equivalent in the degree of crypsis, but the degree of camouflage of the morphs was not consistent with the morph frequency. These findings suggest that trade-offs exist between the camouflage benefit of body colouration and other fitness components, providing a better understanding of the adaptive significance of colour-markings and presumably supporting the differential crypsis hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Endophagous folivores, which are concealed inside leaf tissue for much of their life cycle, or which live externally but feed internally, should be more successful on heavily defended plants than ectophagous species. This is because endophages are more facile at feeding selectively and can manipulate tissue development to avoid physical and chemical defenses and to enhance nutrition. As a result, endophage-ectophage ratios should increase on more heavily defended hosts. This pattern will likely be strengthened by negative asymmetrical interactions with ectophages and pathogens, which may displace endophages from lightly defended hosts. The hypothesis predicts that endophages should be particularly abundant in resource-poor habitats which seem to support a preponderance of heavily defended hosts. Although data do not yet exist for a rigorous test, several observed cases where endophage distributions seem biased toward heavily defended hosts are at least consistent with the hypothesis. Plant defense levels may have little influence on the total number of herbivores associated with a host, but I suggest that guild structure can be profoundly altered.},

When appropriately sampled, rates calculated on longer scales can be projected to a generational timescale. Empirical studies are reviewed concerning: (a) rates of polygenic mutation, (b) rates of response to human versus natural disturbance; and (c) rates of change in a classic study of punctuated equilibrium. Rate studies commonly find phenotypic change on the order of H0 = 0.1 to 0.3 standard deviations per generation. This is fast by any standard.

Spore germination increased with time in free water, and the relative susceptibility of host plants to infection was proportional to the duration of water retention on leaves. Larger leaves captured more water and retained it longer. Unexpectedly, trichomes and leaf wettability did not affect water capture. For clovers planted within natural clover populations at two sites, infection was threefold greater at the wetter site. At the drier site, water retention on the leaf surface was an important predictor of infection rates across host species, but persistent fog and dew at the wetter site reduced the importance of rapid leaf drying. Our results suggest that plant adaptations that reduce water retention on leaves may also reduce disease incidence, but the selective advantage of these traits will vary among habitats.},

An experiment in an English grassland involving long-term exclusions of insect and mollusc herbivores, along with rabbit fencing, showed strong, but opposing, effects of the invertebrate herbivores. Plant species richness declined and biomass increased following insect exclusion, due to increased dominance by a grass species, whereas mollusc exclusion led to increased herbs abundance. The two herbivores had a compensatory interaction: molluscs had no effects in the absence of insects and large insect effects depended on the absence of molluscs. The effects of invertebrate exclusion became apparent only after 8 years, and would have been seriously underestimated in shorter studies. Our results suggest that theorists and conservation managers need to shift from their historic focus on vertebrate herbivory, to a recognition that invertebrates can be equally important drivers of plant community structure.},

We used experimental exclosures, removal of unpalatable species, and transplants of palatable and unpalatable species in subalpine meadows of the Caucasus Mountains of Georgia to study the effects of two unpalatable species on plant communities. We found that Cirsium obalatum and Veratrum lobelianum, two large native perennial herbs that invade after heavy grazing, had strong facilitative effects on communities through their indirect effects on livestock herbivores. These unpalatable invaders had different effects on community composition when livestock were present than when livestock were excluded. Furthermore, removing Cirsium and Veratrum where herbivory was permitted decreased the richness of associated communities, but inside a livestock exclosure removal of these species increased community richness. Transplanted palatable species (Anthoxanthum odoratum and Phleum alpinum) grew larger inside the exclosure, and in the exclosure Cirsium and Veratrum had no effect on their growth. However, outside of the exclosure, Cirsium and Veratrum had strong positive effects on the growth of A. odoratum and P. alpinum. Excluding livestock decreased the growth of Luzula pseudosudetica, another unpalatable species, and Cirsium and Veratrum had no effect on L. pseudosudetica outside the exclosure. In contrast, inside exclosures Cirsium and Veratrum had competitive effects on L. pseudosudetica. Our results indicate that Cirsium and Veratrum, which are in some ways undesirable rangeland weeds, may also play an important role in maintaining species and functional diversity of overgrazed plant communities in the Caucasus.},

We examined gene flow of a hydrochorous wetland macrophyte, Hibiscus moscheutos L. (Malvaceae), by analyzing allozyme variation in current-year floating-seed populations. The genetic composition of floating seeds was compared to the genetic composition of established populations of H. moscheutos that had been previously analyzed in the same areas. The F statistics demonstrated that genetic structuring among floating-seed populations was weak or absent, indicating that seeds from source populations were thoroughly mixed. Floating-seed populations had an excess of homozygotes, a different situation than had previously been found in established populations. The exchange of seeds was greatest among H. moscheutos populations that were adjacent to a tidal stream. We conclude that populations adjacent to the tidal streams are part of a metapopulation that serves as a reserve of genetic variation in the system. Although established populations of H. moscheutos that are not close to the tidal stream are relatively isolated genetically, we found evidence that they also contribute to the floating-seed populations within the estuary.},

The host testing of F. perrepae focused on Lygodium species from North America and the Neotropics, along with threatened or endangered ferns from Florida. Sporeling ferns were used for the initial no-choice screening and F. perrepae showed normal development on the Florida genotype of L. microphyllum with 33.0 ± 4.6 mites per marginal leaf roll gall, modest development on the North American native Lygodium palmatum with 29.0 ± 9.3 mites per roll, and minor development on six other fern species (4.0–0.3). Leaf rolls were induced only on Lygodium species and full rolls were common only on L. microphyllum. These same six non-target plant species were tested again as more mature plants in both no-choice and choice tests and F. perrepae developed only on L. microphyllum. Lethal minimum temperature and cold stress tests were also conducted on F. perrepae. These tests revealed that it would not likely establish north of USDA hardiness zone 8a (−9.5 to −12.2°C), which means it would not overlap with L. palmatum from temperate North America. Our studies conclude that F. perrepae is specific to L. microphyllum, poses little or no risk to native or cultivated ferns in North and South America, and therefore should be considered for release in Florida.},

To test whether differences in means and reaction norms of dispersal-related traits between species affected colonization potential, we created seed-dispersal models based on seed-fall rate and release height.• Differences in plasticity between species were not systematic, but varied in direction and magnitude among traits. Taraxacum officinale produced larger leaves that exhibited greater plasticity in size under variable light intensity than T. ceratophorum. Plasticity in scape length at flowering occurred in relation to R : FR ratio in both species, but tended to be greater in T. ceratophorum. Seed-bearing scapes of T. officinale were taller and more canalized in height across light regimes than scapes of T. ceratophorum. Seeds of T. officinale were smaller than seeds of T. ceratophorum.• Models predict greater dispersal in T. officinale within open and vegetated habitats. In contrast to the idea that plasticity promotes invasiveness, results suggest that the lack of plasticity in dispersal-related traits enhances the colonization potential of T. officinale.},

	abstract = {Fitness interactions where benefits are shared only between individuals with similar traits are often referred to as ‘synergistic’. Examples include defence characters, like insect warning colouration and plant unpalatability, and joint activities needing the active participation of all group members, such as cooperative hunting. Previous analyses, assuming discrete variation in the trait, have shown that synergistic selection can be a sufficient explanation for the evolutionary stability of such traits. Here, we investigate the consequences of graded variation in the trait responsible for synergistic effects. Classifying the synergism as unbiased when an individual receives maximum associational benefit by having the same trait value as its neighbours, and letting a positive (negative) bias represent the maximum above (below) this value, we show that only positively biased synergistic selection can enhance a graded trait. Thus for graded traits, a synergistic benefit is not in itself sufficient for evolutionary stability. We study possible reasons for synergistic bias in a simple model of plant defences against herbivores, and suggest that the processes of herbivore avoidance learning and diet selection are probable causes of positive bias. We propose that mammalian herbivores exposed to a given level of toxicity will show stronger feeding aversion to higher toxicity, resulting in positively biased synergistic selection of plant defence traits. Positive bias produced by avoidance learning may, in a similar way, also select for defence signals.},

	abstract = {1. There are now approximately 10 examples of plants that use volatile cues emitted by damaged neighbours to adjust their defences against herbivores. For two of these examples, preliminary evidence suggested that plants may experience net benefits from such eavesdropping, although eavesdropping was uncommon in one case and estimates of plant fitness were ambiguous in the other case. 2. In the current study, we examined the long-term consequences of exposure to cues emitted by experimentally clipped sagebrush neighbours. In this sagebrush system we have repeatedly found that sagebrush plants that have experimentally clipped neighbours experience less herbivore damage over the season than plants with unclipped control neighbours under field conditions. We followed a cohort of young sagebrush plants from emergence in 1999 for 12 years. Neighbours of half of these plants were artificially clipped every spring from 2004–08 and survival and flowering was measured in each autumn from 1999–2011. 3. Survival of marked branches of young plants was not consistently affected by whether its neighbour was clipped. Plants near clipped neighbours produced more branches during this period than those near unclipped neighbours. There were no measurable treatment effects on plant survival over the 12 years. Branches near clipped neighbours produced more inflorescences than branches near unclipped neighbours. 4. Seedlings were more likely to survive to the end of their first dry season in two different years near clipped neighbours compared to unclipped neighbours. 5. Synthesis. The results suggest different effects of clipped neighbours that depend on plant age. Responding to the cues of experimental clipping may provide a slight net benefit, considering these results and other published studies, even though these cues provided little predictive value about actual risk of herbivory. Responding to reliable cues may be even more beneficial and may favour plants that eavesdrop on neighbours.},

Recently many prospective cases of polymorphisms by NFDS have been reported. Some of them are very complicated, although strongly supportive of the NFDS. Here we investigate NFDS in wild populations of the dimorphic damselfly Ischnura senegalensis, in which females occur as andromorphs and gynomorphs. Specifically, we (1) test fitness responses to morph frequencies, (2) built a simple population genetic model, and (3) compare the observed and predicted morph-frequency dynamics. Fitnesses of the two morphs are an inverse function of its own frequency in a population, and are about equal when their frequencies are similar. Thus the conditions necessary for NFDS are satisfied. The long-term field surveys show that the morph frequencies oscillate with a period of two generations. Morph frequencies in a small population undergo large oscillations whereas those in a large population do small oscillations. The demographic properties of the observed dynamics agree well with those of our model. This example is one of the simplest confirmed cases of NFDS maintaining genetic polymorphisms in nature.},

Because the benefits of plant height depend on which other height strategies are present, competition for light can usefully be framed as a game-theoretic problem. The vertical structure of the world's vegetation, which is inefficient for plant growth, can then be understood as the outcome of evolutionary and ecological arms races. In addition, game-theoretic models predict taller vegetation on sites of higher leaf area index, and allocation to reproduction only after an initial period of height growth. However, of 14 game-theoretic models for height reviewed here, only one predicts coexistence of a mix of height strategies, a conspicuous feature of most vegetation. We suggest that game-theoretic models could help account for observed mixtures of height strategies if they incorporated processes for coexistence along spectra of light income and time since disturbance.},

Here, we present the first study of the reproductive system of Silene nutans, including females, gynomonoecious plants, and hermaphrodites. By measuring 10 floral traits in controlled conditions, we showed that females bear smaller and lighter flowers than hermaphrodites, with female and perfect flowers of gynomonoecious plants being intermediates. By measuring pollen quantity and quality, we showed that gynomonoecious plants had a lower potential male fitness than hermaphrodites at the level of both flowers and individuals. In addition, gynomonoecious plants were shown to widely vary their proportion of female flowers (0.03–0.9) and their floral traits, suggesting a quantitative restoration of male fertility. Finally, controlled pollinations showed evidence for inbreeding depression ( \${\textbackslash}textbackslashdelta =0.3\$ ) in progeny of hermaphrodites and gynomonoecious individuals, affecting both pre‐ and postdispersal traits; this could provide a selective advantage for females.},

Our method treats community development as a sorting process involving species that are ecologically equivalent except with respect to particular functional traits, which leads to a constrained random assembly of species; the relative abundance of each species adheres to a general exponential distribution as a function of its traits. Using data for eight functional traits of 30 herbaceous species and community-aggregated values of these traits in 12 sites along a 42-year chronosequence of secondary succession, we predicted 94\% of the variance in the relative abundances.},

Studies examining correlations between oviposition preference and larval performance have yielded results ranging From good to poor suggesting that features other than a positive correlation between the preference and performance may influence the evolution of host plant use. In this study, we examined oviposition behavior and larval performance of the specialist leafminer Liriomyza helianthi spencer on normal host plants-sunflower, Helianthus annuus L., and cocklebur, Xanthium strumarium L. (Asteraceae, tribe Heliantheae), and a number of novel, but related, plants in the Asteraceae. Using choice and no-choice oviposition experiments, L, helianthi was observed to oviposit preferentially in its normal host plants and in some novel hosts in the same tribe (Heliantheae). Plants outside the normal tribe in both subfamilies of the Asteraceae were rarely used for oviposition. Larval performance, as assayed by development time, developmental rate, larval survivorship and pupal weight, wits assessed by transfers of larvae between normal and novel hosts as well as by direct oviposition into those hosts. The transfer of leafminer larvae allows the decoupling of oviposition and larval performance components of host use, a traditionally difficult task when studying herbivores living inside plant tissues. Our results found no significant relationship between oviposition preference and larval performance in normal and novel hosts. Leafminer larvae have greater latitude than adults in successful use of novel hosts, including use of plants in the alternate subfamily, Cichorioideae. There are some novel plants that are riot used, for oviposition but are as suitable for development as the normal host. Thus, there is an asymmetry between oviposition preference and larval performance in novel hosts.},

The evolutionary significance of parasitism depends on the strength and prevalence of parasite-mediated selection in nature. Here I appraise whether parasitism is a pervasive agent of evolutionary change by detailing empirical evidence for selection. Although there is considerable evidence of genetic variation for resistance, and hence the potential for selection, direct observation of parasite-driven genetic change is lacking.},

	abstract = {A fundamental question concerning crop diversification is which mechanisms determine pest population size in polycultures compared to monocultures. It has been proposed that polyphagous insects experience a difficulty in decision-making when selecting food and oviposition sites in the presence of different host plants. This hypothesis was tested in the extremely polyphagous whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) B-biotype, where behaviour (movement) and fecundity of females were compared in choice and no-choice experiments in the laboratory. Two parallel tests, one on different crops, including cucumber, bean and tomato, and one on different tomato cultivars, were conducted using both a mixture of crops and of tomato cultivars, as opposed to the same crop or cultivar respectively. Bemisia tabaci showed a distinct behavioural preference for cucumber when exposed to different crops simultaneously suggesting that B. tabaci has no difficulty in choosing a host plant, i.e. in making a decision, when one of the plants offered in the choice test is a high-ranking host plant. Conversely, when only low-ranking hosts of similar, but not identical, signatures were present, female whiteflies appeared to have difficulty in making a decision, resulting in increased movement and reduced fecundity. This is consistent with both the hypothesis that polyphagous insects have a problem selecting a host plant when given multiple choices and with the hierarchy threshold model, under which egg loads are lessened between periods of searching for better host plants. The study illustrates how insect behaviour can be affected by intercropping not only with different crops, but also with different cultivars of the same crop, thus potentially providing a simple and efficient way of reducing whitefly population build-up.},

Mechanistic models that explain the observed variety of herbivore responses to local plant community composition have, however, been lacking. We present a model of herbivore responses to patches that consist of two plant types, where herbivore densities on a focal plant are determined by a combination of patch-finding, within-patch redistribution, and patch-leaving. Our analyses show that the effect of plant neighborhood on herbivores depends both on how plant and herbivore traits combine to affect herbivore movement and on how experimental designs reveal the effects of plant density and plant relative frequency. Associational susceptibility should be the dominant pattern when herbivores have biased landing rates within patches. Other behavioral decision rules lead to mixed responses, but a common pattern is that in mixed patches, one plant type experiences associational resistance while the other plant experiences associational susceptibility. In some cases, the associational effect may shift sign along a gradient of plant frequency, suggesting that future empirical studies should include more than two plant frequencies to detect nonlinearities. Finally, we find that associational susceptibility should be commonly observed in experiments using replacement designs, whereas associational resistance will be the dominant pattern when using additive designs. Consequently, outcomes from one experimental design cannot be directly compared to studies with other designs. Our model can also be translated to other systems with foragers searching for multiple resource types.},

Methods Using pooled DNA samples, seven each of wild and domesticated populations of P. vulgaris were studied using 2506 AFLP markers (on average, one every 250 kb). About 10 \% of the markers were also analysed on individual genotypes and were used to infer allelic frequencies empirically from bulk data. In both data sets, tests were made to determine the departure from neutral expectation for each marker using an FST-based method. Key Results The most important outcome is that a large fraction of the genome of the common bean (16 \%; P {\textbackslash}textless 0·01) appears to have been subjected to effects of selection during domestication. Markers obtained in individual genotypes were also mapped and classified according to their proximities to known genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of the domestication syndrome. Most of the markers that were found to be potentially under the effects of selection were located in the proximity of previously mapped genes and QTLs related to the domestication syndrome. Conclusions Overall, the results indicate that in P. vulgaris a large portion of the genome appears to have been subjected to the effects of selection, probably because of linkage to the loci selected during domestication. As most of the markers that are under the effects of selection are linked to known loci related to the domestication syndrome, it is concluded that population genomics approaches are very efficient in detecting QTLs. A method based on bulk DNA samples is presented that is effective in pre-screening for a large number of markers to determine selection signatures.},

Strawberry produces both inflorescences and stolons (also called runners), which are lateral stems growing at the soil surface and producing new clone plants. In this study, the flowering and runnering behaviour of two cultivated octoploid strawberry (Fragaria×ananassa Duch., 2n=8×=56) genotypes, a seasonal flowering genotype CF1116 and a perpetual flowering genotype Capitola, were studied along the growing season. The genetic bases of the perpetual flowering and runnering traits were investigated further using a pseudo full-sibling F1 population issued from a cross between these two genotypes. The results showed that a single major quantitative trait locus (QTL) named FaPFRU controlled both traits in the cultivated octoploid strawberry. This locus was not orthologous to the loci affecting perpetual flowering (SFL) and runnering (R) in Fragaria vesca, therefore suggesting different genetic control of perpetual flowering and runnering in the diploid and octoploid Fragaria spp. Furthermore, the FaPFRU QTL displayed opposite effects on flowering (positive effect) and on runnering (negative effect), indicating that both traits share common physiological control. These results suggest that this locus plays a major role in strawberry plant fitness by controlling the balance between sexual and asexual plant reproduction.},

In semi-arid ecosystems of Chile, the perennial herb Convolvulus chilensis (Convolvulaceae) suffers heavy herbivory by small mammals when growing prostrate but plants seem to be protected when they are climbing onto cacti or thorny shrubs (nurse species). * 2Field observations suggest that damaged main stems have a greater number of small lateral stems, which greatly enhance climbing success. In this field study we addressed whether C. chilensis shows associational resistance by climbing onto nurse species, and evaluated whether damage and also shade (a cue for neighbour presence) elicit architectural responses that enhance climbing probability. * 3We documented associational resistance for C. chilensis: climbing individuals growing associated with cacti and thorny shrubs suffered less herbivory (percentage of damaged stems: 35 vs. 98) and had greater reproductive output (number of reproductive structures at the end of the season: 150 vs. 0) than prostrate individuals growing in isolation. Experimental clipping of the main stem caused plants to produce a greater number of lateral stems both in sun (70\% increase) and in shade (66\% increase) treatments. Moreover, stem damage caused a 50\% increase in the number of stems actually climbing on a support, but only in shade. * 4Synthesis. We show for the first time that phenotypic responses to herbivory of the potentially protected species may enhance association with the defended nurse species, thereby promoting associational resistance. This finding adds a new perspective for mechanistic studies of positive interactions among plants, suggesting that behavioural responses of the protégée may mediate the magnitude of nurse effects.},

	abstract = {Abstract.—Linanthus parryae, a diminutive desert annual with white or blue flowers, has been the focus of a longstanding debate among evolutionary biologists. At issue is whether the flower color polymorphism in this species is the product of random genetic drift, as Sewall Wright argued, or of natural selection, as proposed by Carl Epling and his colleagues. Our long-term studies of three polymorphic populations in the Mojave Desert demonstrate that flower color is subject to selection that varies in both time and space in its direction and magnitude. For all sites taken together, blue-flowered plants produced more seeds than white-flowered plants in years of relatively low seed production, whereas white-flowered plants had higher fitness in years of high seed production. Evidence of selection on flower color was found in two of the three study sites. Differences in fitness between the color morphs were sometimes large, with selection coefficients as high as 0.60 in some years. Our longest period of observations was at Pearblossom site 1, where plants reached appreciable densities in seven of the 11 years of study. Here we found significant differences in the seed production of the color morphs in six years, with three years of blue advantage and three years of white advantage. For all sites taken together, total spring precipitation (March and April) was positively correlated with both absolute and relative seed production of the color morphs. At Pearblossom site 1, blue-flowered plants typically had a fitness advantage in years of low spring precipitation, whereas white-flowered plants had a fitness advantage in years of high spring precipitation. This temporal variation in selection may contribute to the maintenance of the flower-color polymorphism at Pearblossom site 1, whereas gene flow from neighboring populations is proposed as the principal factor maintaining the polymorphism at the other study sites. We found no significant differences between the color morphs in pollinator visitation rate or in their carbon isotope ratio, a measure of water-use efficiency. Although the mechanism of selection remains elusive, our results refute Wright's conclusion that the flower color polymorphism in L. parryae is an example of isolation by distance, a key component of his shifting balance theory of evolution.},

We used the annual species Brassica nigra to (1) test scales of differentiation and adaptation among coastal wetland and inland river-valley populations and (2) analyze herbivory as a potential driver of local plant adaptation. • Methods: In a common garden experiment, we compared seven populations collected at different geographic scales in both habitat types. To evaluate adaptation to herbivory, we removed the aphid Brevicoryne brassicae from half of the plants. In a reciprocal transplant experiment, we tested local adaptation in two coastal and two river-valley populations. Natural colonization by dominant herbivore species was recorded. • Key Results: In the common garden, the river-valley populations showed a higher performance than the coastal ones, whereas large-scale differentiation within habitats was small. Such a differentiation among plant populations was also found in spontaneous infestation by several herbivore groups but not in the plant response to aphid removal. In the reciprocal transplant experiment at natural sites, both plant populations performed better in their home habitat, indicating local adaptation to environmental differences between coastal and river-valley sites. A lower aphid infestation on local plants suggests a contribution of herbivores to local plant adaptation and illustrates the need for reciprocal transplant experiments to evaluate this contribution. • Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that adaptive differentiation among habitats may be stronger at relatively small scales than large-scale adaptation within these habitats. It provides new insights into the role of herbivory in driving local plant adaptation.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims The Mediterranean Basin is one of the most important regions for the Earth's plant biodiversity; however, the scarcity of studies on fine scale patterns of genetic variation in this region is striking. Here, an assessment is made of the spatial genetic structure of all known locations of the three Sardinian endemic species of Aquilegia in order to determine the relative roles of gene flow and genetic drift as underlying evolutionary forces canalizing the divergence of Sardinian Aquilegia taxa, and to see if the spatial genetic structure found fits the current taxonomic differentiation of these taxa. Methods DNA from 89 individuals from all known locations of Aquilegia across Sardinia was analysed by means of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Both principal co-ordinates analysis (PCoA) and Bayesian clustering analyses were used to determine the spatial genetic structure irrespective of any taxonomic affiliation. Historical effects of gene flow and genetic drift were assessed by checking for the existence of isolation-by-distance patterns. Key Results STRUCTURE and PCoA analyses revealed a pattern of genetic variation geographically structured into four spatial genetic groups. No migration–drift equilibrium was detected for Aquilegia in Sardinia, when analysed either as a whole or in individual groups. The scenario approached a Case III pattern sensu Hutchinson and Templeton, which is associated with extreme isolation conditions where genetic drift has historically played a dominant role over gene flow. Conclusions The pattern of genetic variation of Sardinian taxa of Aquilegia indicates that genetic drift has been historically more influential than gene flow on population structure of Sardinian species of Aquilegia. Limited seed dispersal and divergent selection imposed by habitat conditions have been probably the main causes reinforcing post-Pleistocene geographical isolation of Aquilegia populations. The spatial genetic structure found here is not fully compatible with current taxonomic affiliations of Sardinian Aquilegia taxa. This is probably a consequence of the uncoupling between morphological and genetic patterns of differentiation frequently found in recently radiated taxa.},

	abstract = {A plant's responses to attack from particular pathogens and herbivores may result in resistance to subsequent attack from the same species, but may also affect different species. Such a cross-resistance, called immunization or vaccination, can benefit the plant, if the fitness consequences of attack from the initial attacker are less than those from subsequent attackers. Here, we report an example of naturally occurring vaccination of the native tobacco plant, Nicotiana attenuata, against Manduca hornworms by prior attack from the mirid bug, Tupiocoris notatus (Dicyphus minimus), which results from the elicitation of two categories of induced plant responses. First, attack from both herbivore species causes the plants in nature to release predator-attracting volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and the attracted generalist predator, Geocoris pallens, preferentially attacks the less mobile hornworm larvae. Second, attack from both mirids and hornworms increases the accumulation of secondary metabolites and proteinase inhibitors (PIs) in the leaf tissue, which is correlated with the slow growth of Manduca larvae. Mirid damage does not significantly reduce the fitness of the plant in nature, whereas attack from the hornworm reduces lifetime seed production. Consequently, plants that are attacked by mirids realize a significant fitness advantage in environments with both herbivores.

	abstract = {* • Brake fern, Pteris vittata, not only tolerates arsenic but also hyperaccumulates it in the frond. The hypothesis that arsenic hyperaccumulation in this fern could function as a defense against insect herbivory was tested. * • Fronds from control and arsenic-treated ferns were presented to nymphs of the grasshopper Schistocerca americana. Feeding damage was recorded by visual observation and quantification of the fresh weight of frond left uneaten and number of fecal pellets produced over a 2-d period. Grasshopper weight was determined before and after 5 d of feeding. * • Grasshoppers consumed significantly greater amounts of the frond tissue, produced more fecal pellets and had increased body weight on control plants compared with grasshoppers fed arsenic-treated ferns. Very little or none of the arsenic-treated ferns were consumed indicating feeding deterrence. In a feeding deterrent experiment with lettuce, sodium arsenite at 1.0 mm deterred grasshoppers from feeding whereas 0.1 mm did not. In a choice experiment, grasshoppers preferred to feed on lettuce dipped in water compared with lettuce dipped in 1.0 mm sodium arsenite. * • Our results show that arsenic hyperaccumulation in brake fern is an elemental defense against grasshopper herbivory.},

	abstract = {Dispersal distances overestimate the gene-flow scale l (the square-root of the mean squared distance travelled from birth to reproduction) when egg laying is concentrated early in dispersal and when there is mortality during dispersal. If egg laying follows a square-root normal distribution in time, as it does in several Drosophila species, then l is reduced to about 0.6 of that estimated from dispersal alone, unless egg laying is concentrated in a very brief period. If mortality is such that the half-life is earlier than the mean fecundity day, then l will be reduced still more relative to the dispersal estimate, and will be very sensitive to small changes in mortality. Overestimating l yields overestimates of the amount of selection needed to maintain geographic differences in gene frequencies. If mortality increases in suboptimal habitats, then the neighborhood size will be smaller in those areas, because increased mortality decreases l. This means that l is smallest, allowing the greatest differentiation and genetic innovation, precisely where it is most needed. This lends support to Wright's shifting balance hypothesis. If l is adjusted to local conditions, then we do not necessarily expect a positive relationship between environmental and genetic heterogeneity. Data from Drosophila pseudoobscura are used to make the models realistic, and it is shown that l depends on the distances among traps or breeding sites. It is therefore essential to know the geometry of breeding sites and the life history parameters to estimate l.},

We investigated, using correlative analyses, the relationships between dry matter intake and a range of foliage chemical characteristics, including measures of nutritional quality (total nitrogen, cellulose, hemi-cellulose, lignin, in vitro dry matter digestibility) and plant secondary chemistry (total phenolics, condensed tannins, cyanogenic glycosides, terpenes, and sideroxylonal, a recently identified Eucalyptus toxin). Significant relationships were identified only for terpenes (and 1,8-cineole in particular) and sideroxylonal. Bioassay experiments confirmed that the foliar concentration of sideroxylonal alone was sufficient to explain the variation observed. To undertake a field study of variation in foliar sideroxylonal and dry matter intake by possums of E. polyanthemos, we developed calibrations of both variables against the near infrared spectra of foliage samples. Acceptable calibration equations were developed, and we applied these to samples collected from a number of E. polyanthemos individuals within an area approximating the home range size of common ringtail possums. We found that foliar sideroxylonal varied from nil to 12.6 mg/g, while predicted dry matter intakes by possums ranged from nil to 42.8 g·(kg body mass)−0.75·d−1. We conclude that significant patchiness in nutritional quality of foliage, resulting from variation in foliar concentrations of a single compound, exists at a scale relevant to the feeding decisions of individual animals.},

Once established as seedlings, oaks face potential herbivory by mammals and phytophagous insects. To determine potential damage of a common generalist insect herbivore on oak seedlings, we conducted performance and preference tests using a grasshopper (Melanoplus sanguinipes) and two species of oaks (Quercus agrifolia and Quercus engelmannii) occurring in a southern California oak grassland. Q. agrifolia is abundant and often used in restoration plantings, while Q. engelmannii has the smallest range of all native oaks in California. To quantify herbivore performance, we measured leaf area of 30 Q. agrifolia and 30 Q. engelmannii seedlings, and caged them individually with a single grasshopper within acetate feeding arenas. Performance then was estimated by determining amount of leaf area eaten and frass produced. Grasshopper preference for either oak species was estimated in replicated choice experiments. M. sanguinipes consumed significantly more leaf area and produced significantly more frass when feeding only on Q. agrifolia than when feeding solely on Q. engelmannii. Additionally, grasshoppers feeding on Q. agrifolia gained significantly more biomass, whereas those feeding on Q. engelmannii actually lost biomass. Q. agrifolia provided a better diet than Q. engelmannii for this grasshopper species, a result that has the potential to affect the success of seedling planting programs in areas where both oaks and M. sanguinipes occur.},

Although a great deal is known about cold tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana, it is not highly cold tolerant. This study examined cold tolerance and its genetic diversity in an herbaceous subarctic relative, Arabidopsis kamchatica, which generally occurs in much colder climates. • Methods: Thermal analysis and electrolyte leakage were used to estimate supercooling points and lethal temperatures (LT50) in cold-acclimated and nonacclimated families from three populations of A. kamchatica. • Key results: Arabidopsis kamchatica was highly cold tolerant, with a mean LT50 of −10.8°C when actively growing, and −21.8°C when cold acclimated. It also was able to supercool to very low temperatures. Surprisingly, actively growing plants supercooled more than acclimated plants (−14.7 vs. −12.7°C). There was significant genetic variation for cold tolerance both within and among populations. However, both cold tolerance and genetic diversity were highest in the midlatitude population rather than in the far north, indicating that adaptations to climate change are most likely to arise in the center of the species range rather than at the edges. • Conclusions: Arabidopsis kamchatica is highly cold tolerant throughout its range. It is far more freeze tolerant than A. thaliana, and supercooled to lower temperatures, suggesting that A. kamchatica provides a valuable complement to A. thaliana for cold tolerance research.},

For V. hirta and V. mirabilis the effects of sibling competition were examined, for V. riviniana the effects of interspecific (grass) competition. Seed abortion and seed weight were also taken into account as fitness measures. In none of the species, seed abortion rate differed between CH and CL capsules. In V. mirabilis and V. riviniana, CL seeds had a lower germination rate than CH seeds. In V. hirta the two seed types did not differ in germinability. Mortality did not differ between the two seedling types in any of the species. In V. hirta and V. riviniana, CL progeny had shorter mean length of largest leaf than CH progeny. In V. mirabilis plant size did not differ between progeny types. Sibling competition had little effect on offspring performance, but grass competition increased mortality and reduced plant size of V. riviniana progeny. The two progeny types did not differ in their response to sibling and grass competition. The differences in performance between progeny types could be attributable to inbreeding depression in the CL phase, but the slightly lower fitness of CL offspring is probably balanced by their lower production costs. It is suggested that a dimorphic reproductive system is maintained in perennial Viola species to maximize total seed output in the face of environmental variation.},

Yet many studies have not demonstrated local adaptation, suggesting that sometimes native populations are no better adapted than are genotypes from foreign environments. Local adaptation may also lead to trade‐offs, in which adaptation to one environment comes at a cost of adaptation to another environment. I conducted a survey of published studies of local adaptation to quantify its frequency and magnitude and the costs associated with local adaptation. I also quantified the relationship between local adaptation and environmental differences and the relationship between local adaptation and phenotypic divergence. The overall frequency of local adaptation was 0.71, and the magnitude of the native population advantage in relative fitness was 45\%. Divergence between home site environments was positively associated with the magnitude of local adaptation, but phenotypic divergence was not. I found a small negative correlation between a population’s relative fitness in its native environment and its fitness in a foreign environment, indicating weak trade‐offs associated with local adaptation. These results suggest that populations are often locally adapted but stochastic processes such as genetic drift may limit the efficacy of divergent selection.},

Here, we study the geographic patterns of abundance and diversity of herbivorous insects, the untargeted metabolome of the foliage and genetic variation in a set of wound-induced genes and show that the geographic structure co-occurs in all three data sets. In response to this structure, we observe local maladaptation of herbivores, with fewer herbivores on local trees than on trees originated from more distant localities.

	abstract = {When attacked by a phloem-feeding greenbug aphid (Schizaphis graminum), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) activates jasmonic acid (JA)- and salicylic acid (SA)-regulated genes, as well as genes outside known wounding and SA signaling pathways. A collection of 672 cDNAs was obtained by differential subtraction with cDNAs prepared from sorghum seedlings infested by greenbug aphids and those from uninfested seedlings. Subsequent expression profiling using DNA microarray and northern-blot analyses identified 82 transcript types from this collection responsive to greenbug feeding, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), or SA application. DNA sequencing analyses indicated that these encoded proteins functioning in direct defense, defense signaling, oxidative burst, secondary metabolism, abiotic stress, cell maintenance, and photosynthesis, as well as proteins of unknown function. In response to insect feeding, sorghum increased transcript abundance of numerous defense genes, with some SA-dependent pathogenesis-related genes responding to greenbug more strongly than to SA. In contrast, only weak induction of MeJA-regulated defense genes was observed after greenbug treatment. However, infestation tests confirmed that JA-regulated pathways were effective in plant defense against greenbugs. Activation of certain transcripts exclusively by greenbug infestation was observed, and may represent unique signal transduction events independent of JA- and SA-regulated pathways. Results indicate that plants coordinately regulate defense gene expression when attacked by phloem-feeding aphids, but also suggest that aphids are able to avoid triggering activation of some otherwise potentially effective plant defensive machinery, possibly through their particular mode of feeding.},

On the molecular level, we detected substantial sequence variation in a 3-kb fragment which included the complete coding region of the GL1 locus (π = 0.01). Phylogenetic analysis of GL1 indicates the presence of two diverged clades among 28 accessions. Using ANOVA, we show that the phenotypic variation in trichome density cannot be explained by the sequence divergence between the two phylogenetic lineages. Sequence analysis of wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata accessions indicates that all amino acid substitutions are located outside of the conserved helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domains R2 and R3. Using plants of A. thaliana and A. lyrata with either naturally occurring or ethyl methane sulfonate–induced glabrous phenotypes, we demonstrate that the last 14 C-terminal amino acids of the GL1 gene have no major impact on the initiation of trichomes.},

We present a method for calibrating spatial models of plant recruitment that does not require identifying the specific parent of each recruit. This method calibrates seedling recruitment functions by comparing tree seedling distributions with adult distributions via a maximum likelihood analysis. The models obtained from this method can then be used to predict the spatial distributions of seedlings from adult distributions. We calibrated recruitment functions for 10 tree species characteristics of transition oak—northern hardwood forests. Significant differences were found in recruit abundances and spatial distributions. Predicted seedling recruitment limitation for test stands varied substantially between species, with little recruitment limitation for some species and strong recruitment limitation for others. Recruitment was limited due to low overall recruit production or to restricted recruit dispersion. When these seedlings recruitment parameters were incorporated into a spatial, individual—based model of forest dynamics, called SORTIE, alterations of recruitment parameters produced substantial changes in species abundance, providing additional support for the potential importance of seedling recruitment processes in community structure and dynamics.

A number of root-hair and leaf-trichome patterning mutants and tools for cell-specific and tissue-specific manipulation of patterning protein activities have been combined in cycles of experimentation and mathematical modelling. These approaches have provided insight into molecular mechanisms of epidermal patterning. During the last two years, endoreplication has, unexpectedly, been found to control cell-fate maintenance during trichome patterning. New genetic interactions between a downstream, positive transcriptional regulator and lateral inhibitors of trichome or non-root-hair fate specification have been uncovered. A lateral inhibitor and a new positive regulator have been identified as major loci affecting trichome patterning in natural Arabidopsis populations. Finally, factors that modify root-hair patterning from the underlying cell layer have been discovered.},

In this work, four species of Lepidoptera and three species of Hemiptera were fed single or mixed foods to test the hypothesis that individual generalists would benefit from mixing their diets. In all cases, insects were provided with one of three different host plants, or a mixture of all three. For most species, several different experiments were performed. Survivorship, gain in mass, and fecundity were used as measures of performance. In no case was there evidence that mixtures were better than single foods. It is argued that, in these taxa, the value of being a generalist lies largely with versatility for use of different hosts, rather than for dietary mixing. The contrast with Orthoptera, in which individuals commonly obtain substantial benefit from dietary mixing, is also discussed.},

	url = {http://www.springerlink.com/content/e644vtqk64cg6j0l/abstract/},
	abstract = {When foraging for nectar many insects exhibit flower constancy (a preference for flower species which they have previously visited) and frequently ignore rewarding flowers of other species. Darwin proposed the favoured explanation for this behaviour, hypothesizing that learning of handling skills for one flower species interferes with the ability to recall handling skills for previously learned species. A crucial element of this hypothesis is that savings in handling time resulting from constancy must exceed increases in travelling time necessitated by ignoring other suitable species. A convincing quantification of this trade-off has not been achieved and tests to date on bumblebees indicate that savings in handling time are too small to offset an increase in travelling time. To assess further the validity of Darwin’s hypothesis, handling and flight times of the butterfly, Thymelicus flavus, were measured under natural conditions, and the abundance and reward provided by the available flower species quantified to enable estimation of foraging efficiency. Butterflies exhibited a mean increase in handling time of 0.85 s per flower associated with switching between flower species, although the magnitude of this difference varied greatly among flower species. Switching was not associated with a decrease in travelling time, contrary to expectation. Switching was more frequent following a lower than average reward from the last flower visited. In butterflies, flights serve functions other than movement between nectar sources, such as mate location (unlike worker bees). Hence constancy may be a viable strategy to reduce time spent in handling flowers and increase time available for other activities. Although savings in handling time may be small, Darwin’s interference hypothesis remains a valid explanation for flower constancy in foraging butterflies.},

A growing body of evidence suggests that phytophagous beetles, mainly species from the superfamilies Chrysomeloidea and Curculionoidea, possess endogenous genes encoding complex and diverse families of so-called plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs). The presence of these genes in phytophagous beetles may have been a key element in their success as herbivores. Here, we combined a proteomics approach and transcriptome sequencing to identify PCWDEs present in larval gut contents of the mustard leaf beetle, Phaedon cochleariae.},

Changes in the pest status, distribution range, winter mortality, and the synchronization in phenology were examined. The increase in the number of annual generations of each taxon was predicted based on the lower developmental threshold and the thermal constant. Increasing damage due to rice- and fruit-infesting bugs, their simultaneous outbreaks and the poleward geographic spread observed for six species may be triggered by global warming. The winter mortality of adults of Nezara viridula and Halyomorpha halys is predicted to be reduced by 15\% by each rise of 1°C. More than 50 species of butterflies showed northward range expansions and ten species of previously migrant butterflies established on Nansei Islands during 1966–1987. Global warming may be responsible for the recent decline in abundance of Plutella xylostella and the increase in Helicoverpa armigera and Trichoplusia ni. In general, global warming may work in favour of natural enemies (except for spiders) by increasing the number of generations more than in their host species. Biological control utilizing native natural enemies is expected to become a more important control tactic in the future. Greenhouse culture may provide a model of a temperate agroecosystem after global warming. The increasing occurrence of alien species of tropical origin in association with the increase in pesticide applications might be expected. Interception of alien pests by plant quarantine followed by integrated pest management is needed.},

Here, we explore the role of environmental heterogeneity in the maintenance of variation in leaf hair (trichome) production in Arabidopsis kamchatica. • Methods: We investigate abiotic correlates of trichome production in A. kamchatica via surveys of both herbarium specimens and wild populations. In addition, we examine patterns of phenotypic selection on trichome production among populations that differ in environmental characteristics. • Key results: Trichome-producing herbarium specimens were more likely to occur at lower latitudes and in locations with lower mean annual precipitation and less annual variation in temperature than glabrous specimens. In surveys of wild populations, frequencies of trichome-producing plants were higher in drier habitats than in wetter environments. Using phenotypic selection analysis, we found divergent selection through female fitness (fruit production) on trichome number in populations that differ in environmental characteristics; there was selection for reduced trichome number in one population and selection for increased trichome number in another population. In a population containing both glabrous and trichome-producing plants, glabrous plants produced significantly more fruits than trichome-producing individuals, which indicates selection against the trichome morph. • Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that there is heterogeneity in selection among populations, which could be responsible for the maintenance of trichome variation in Alaskan populations of A. kamchatica.},

	abstract = {The theory of automimicry is explored mathematically on the assumption that predators can learn to avoid noxious prey by sight for some finite period after a single noxious experience. Automimetic advantage is an inevitable consequence of the evolution of an unpalatability dimorphism. An established automimetic situation is analogous to an established perfect Batesian mimicry situation, although the evolutionary bases of the two phenomena are different. In both situations, the mimetic advantage depends upon the proportion of unpalatable prey, the memory span of the predators, and the abundance of the prey relative to the predators. Automimetic advantage is maximal when the prey are neither too common nor too rare. Remarkably low proportions of unpalatable prey can confer very substantial immunity to the population. A surprising prediction of the model is that the evolution of unpalatability will not occur in rare prey species unless they first become Batesian mimics. This in turn could lead to the evolution of mimicry complexes containing many species forming a whole spectrum of unpalatability.},

In 261 simple choice tests, 160 individuals were tested for various combinations of three acyanogenic and three cyanogenic varieties. They showed a clear preference for the acyanogenic morphs, both in comparisons between opposite cyanotypes and in two control situations involving either self-comparisons or comparisons between similar cyanotypes. In 320 repeated choice tests, 40 voles assigned to three groups (comparisons between opposite cyanotypes and control comparisons between similar cyanotypes) were tested eight times for the same alternative. They showed a persistent preference for the acyanogenic morph and significantly reduced their total food consumption when they had a strictly cyanogenic diet.

Plant genetic variation exists along a scale, ranging from variation among individual plant genotypes to variation among plant species. Along this scale, herbivores may adapt and diverge at any level, yet few studies have examined whether herbivore differentiation exhibits scaling with respect to host variation (e.g., from genotypes to species). Determining at which level(s) herbivore differentiation occurs can provide insight into the importance of plant genetic variation on herbivore evolution. Previous studies have found strong genetic differentiation in the eriophyid mite, Aceria parapopuli, between hybrid Populus hosts and parental Populus species, but minimal neutral-locus differentiation among individual trees of the same species. We tested whether genetic differentiation in A. parapopuli scales with genetic variation in its Populus hosts. Using mite ITS1 sequence data collected among host species and among host populations, two key patterns emerged. (1) We found strong differentiation of A. parapopuli among Populus species, supporting the hypothesis that plant species differences drive reproductive isolation and HAD. (2) We did not find evidence of host-driven genetic differentiation in mites at the level of plant populations, suggesting that this level of plant variation is insufficiently strong to drive differentiation at a neutral locus. In combination with previous studies, we found that HAD occurs at the higher levels of plant genetic variation, but not at lower levels, and conclude that HAD depends on the scale of plant genetic variation examined.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/321310},
	abstract = {Abstract: Several indices of reproductive skew that quantify the degree of unequal partitioning of reproductive output among individuals have been proposed without consensus on their merits and defects. We believe that the major reason for the disagreement is the lack of discussion on what the population parameter of skew (population skew or true skew) should measure. In our view, the skew index should be an unbiased estimate of a population skew, and the estimated skew needs to satisfy the following two conditions. First, if the group size is equal and the distribution of potential of reproductive output (π), which is scaled by the proportion of the individual's to the total group reproductive output, is also fixed, skew remains constant even when the total number of offspring in the group changes. Second, if the group size is different, skew should have intuitive biological meaning. Our analyses revealed that, among various indices so far proposed, only the skews estimated by Kokko and Lindström's λ and Morisita's Iδ satisfy the first condition. However, the two indices estimate different population parameters, thus implying different biological meanings. Morisita's Iδ is a linear function of CV2 (squared coefficient of variation) of π, and λ is a positive function of \${\textbackslash}textbackslashSigma {\textbackslash}textbackslash:{\textbackslash}textbackslashpi ˆ\{2\}\_\{i\}\$ when offspring number follows a multinomial distribution. In the special cases where a group consists of discrete classes of breeders and nonbreeders, λ behaves roughly inversely parallel to the absolute number of breeders, while Iδ moves almost parallel to the proportion of nonbreeders. Furthermore, λ is sensitive to the total proportion of reproductive output possessed by the dominants but is relatively less sensitive to the number of subordinates. We discussed the possible situations where either of the two indices will be useful.},

	abstract = {1 Selection can favour herbivores that choose host plants benefitting their offspring either by enhancing growth rates or by increasing larval defences against native predators. For exotic predator species that feed on herbivores, their success with invading new habitats may depend upon overcoming defences used by native prey. Whether exotic predators can alter herbivore host choice has remained unexamined. Therefore, we compared the efficacy of larval defence by Chrysomela knabi (a native beetle species) that had fed on two native willow hosts: Salix sericea (a phenolic glycoside (PG)-rich species) and Salix eriocephala (a PG-poor species), when attacked by exotic generalist predators. In addition, the preference and performance of C. knabi on S. sericea and S. eriocephala was examined.2 Chrysomela knabi preferred and performed better on S. sericea. In a common garden, adult C. knabi were nine-fold more common and oviposited five-fold more frequently on S. sericea than on S. eriocephala. In the laboratory, adult feeding preference on leaf discs and survival rates of larvae were both greater on S. sericea, and time to pupation was shorter.3 Chrysomela knabi larvae produced significantly more salicylaldehyde when fed S. sericea leaves than when fed S. eriocephala leaves. Additionally, those larvae with greater salicylaldehyde had reduced predation by two exotic generalist predators, Harmonia axyridis larvae and juvenile Tenodera aridifolia sinensis.4 The results obtained in the present study suggest that selection favoured the preference of C. knabi for PG-rich willow plants because larvae grew and survived better and that selection by common exotic generalist predators would reinforce this preference.},

We conducted a series of no-choice experiments in a laboratory wind tunnel to examine the behavioral response of the specialist fruit fly, Neoceratitis cyanescens (Diptera: Tephritidae), to host visual and olfactory stimuli presented singly or in combination (e.g., colored fruit model with or without host fruit odor). We also studied the influence of wind flow, age, and sex on the response of flies. In two-choice experiments, we evaluated the ability of mature females to discriminate between two fruit models emitting host vs. non-host fruit odor or clean air. Neoceratitis cyanescens mature females can use independently or interactively olfactory and visual stimuli to locate their host, whereas immature females and males respond primarily to host fruit odor. In the absence of wind, mature females mainly use visual information to locate the host fruit. In wind, host fruit odor significantly increases the probability and speed of locating the host fruit. In a two-choice situation between two bright orange spheres, flies accurately detected the sphere emitting host fruit odor vs. non-host fruit odor or odorless air. Nevertheless, they preferred to land on the bright orange sphere when the sphere emitting host fruit odor was blue. Furthermore, when odor source and fruit model were spatially decoupled (90 or 180°), {\textbackslash}textgreater50\% flies that landed on the fruit model initially performed an oriented flight toward the odor source, then turned back to the fruit model while in flight or after one landing, thus suggesting visual information to be the ultimate indicator of host fruit.},

However, such adaptations do not prevent the transfer of pollen between flowers on the same plant (geitonogamy). Recent empirical studies, aided by advances in field techniques, statistical methods and modelling, show that geitonogamy often is substantial and increases with plant size. Selfing by geitonogamy incurs a fitness cost of reduced pollen export, and recent reports show that seed set can suffer as well, even in self-incompatible species. Geitonogamy has important implications for sex-allocation theory, the evolution of dioecy and other issues in evolutionary biology.},

	abstract = {Understanding the ecological consequences of biodiversity is a fundamental challenge. Research on a key component of biodiversity, genetic diversity, has traditionally focused on its importance in evolutionary processes, but classical studies in evolutionary biology, agronomy and conservation biology indicate that genetic diversity might also have important ecological effects. Our review of the literature reveals significant effects of genetic diversity on ecological processes such as primary productivity, population recovery from disturbance, interspecific competition, community structure, and fluxes of energy and nutrients. Thus, genetic diversity can have important ecological consequences at the population, community and ecosystem levels, and in some cases the effects are comparable in magnitude to the effects of species diversity. However, it is not clear how widely these results apply in nature, as studies to date have been biased towards manipulations of plant clonal diversity, and little is known about the relative importance of genetic diversity vs. other factors that influence ecological processes of interest. Future studies should focus not only on documenting the presence of genetic diversity effects but also on identifying underlying mechanisms and predicting when such effects are likely to occur in nature.},

	abstract = {Latex is widely found among plant species and is known to play a defensive role against certain herbivores. Two romaine lettuce, Lactuca sativa L. (Asteraceae) cultivars, ‘Valmaine’ (resistant) and ‘Tall Guzmaine’ (susceptible), were selected to study the potential of latex as a defense mechanism against the banded cucumber beetle, Diabrotica balteata LeConte (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). Latex from Valmaine strongly inhibited feeding of adult D. balteata compared to latex from Tall Guzmaine when applied to the surface of artificial diet. Beetles consumed significantly less diet from disks treated with Valmaine latex than they consumed from diet treated with Tall Guzmaine latex, in both choice and no-choice tests. In a choice test involving diet disks treated with Valmaine latex from young leaves vs. disks treated with latex from mature leaves, the beetles consumed significantly less diet treated with latex from young leaves. No significant difference in diet consumption was found between diets treated with latex from young and mature leaves of Tall Guzmaine in choice tests. Three solvents of differing polarity (water, methanol, and methylene chloride) were tested to extract deterrent compounds from latex; Valmaine latex extracted with water:methanol (20:80) strongly inhibited beetle feeding when applied to the surface of artificial diet. In no-choice tests, fewer beetles were observed feeding on diet treated with water:methanol (20:80) extract of Valmaine latex than on diet treated with a similar extract of Tall Guzmaine latex, resulting in significantly less consumption of the diet treated with the Valmaine latex extract. These studies suggest that moderately polar chemicals within latex may account for resistance in Valmaine to D. balteata.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the extent to which differences in pollen tube growth rates can provide prezygotic reproductive isolation between Mimulus nasutus and its presumed progenitor, Mimulus guttatus. Mimulus nasutus is partially cleistogamous, but its larger chasmogamous flowers offer appreciable opportunity for outcrossing. Mimulus nasutus was found to have smaller pollen grains and shorter styles than M. guttatus. No differences were observed in pollen grain germination on conspecific and heterospecific stigmas. However, pollen tube growth rates of M. nasutus were found to be much slower than those of M. guttatus in the styles of that species. Consequently, any M. nasutus pollen transferred to an M. guttatus stigma was found to be competitively disadvantaged in an M. gutattus style. By contrast, no difference in pollen tube growth rate was detected between the species when growing in M. nasutus styles, possibly because M. nasutus styles are unable to support fast pollen tube growth. We tested the prediction from the pollen tube studies that a 50∶50 mix of M. guttatus and M. nasutus pollen would produce 50\% hybrid seeds when M. nasutus was the maternal parent, and near to 0\% hybrid seed when M. guttatus was the maternal parent. The results were found to support this prediction. We conclude that pollen–pistil interactions can effect strong reproductive isolation between these species, as M. guttatus pollen tubes have a competitive advantage over those of M. nasutus in an M. guttatus style, but not in an M. nasutus style.},

We investigated the early life effects of imbalanced nutrient intake on key fitness components and how such effects can be overcome in a generalist leaf-feeding lepidopteran caterpillar, Spodoptera litura. Over the fifth larval instar, caterpillars were pretreated on one of three diets that varied in protein and carbohydrate content (p35:c7, p21:c21 or p7:c35; \% dry mass). After moulting to the sixth instar, they were transferred to one of three no-choice diets (p35:c7, p21:c21 or p7:c35) or a food choice where they received two nutritionally complementary diets (p35:c7 versus p7:c35). Approximately 80\% of caterpillars that had been protein-deprived (p7:c35) during the fifth instar moulted to the seventh instar and developed into heavier pupae than those pupating after the sixth instar. The threshold body mass for pupal metamorphosis was 144 mg at the start of the sixth instar. Ingesting a diet low in protein or carbohydrate during the early instar led to a deficit in body protein or lipid content, respectively. When given a choice, caterpillars pretreated on the low-protein diet (p7:c35) selected significantly more protein and thus had a higher intake ratio of protein to carbohydrate than those from other diets (p35:c7, p21:c21). Our results suggest that caterpillars are not only capable of switching their developmental program to reduce the deleterious effects of an early deficiency of protein, but also flexible at adjusting nutrient preferences to redress specific nutritional imbalances experienced early in life.},

Significant karyotype evolution in A. thaliana with base chromosome number reduction from x=8 to x=5 might indicate and favor effective genetic isolation from these other species, although hybrids are occurring naturally and have been also constituted under controlled conditions. We tested the evolutionary significance to separate the x=5 from the x=8 lineage using DNA sequence data from the plastome and the nuclear ribosomal DNA based on an extensive, representative worldwide sampling of nearly all taxonomic entities. We conclude that (i) A. thaliana is clearly separated phylogenetically from the x=8 lineage, (ii) five major lineages outside A. thaliana can be identified (A. lyrata, A. arenosa, A. halleri, Arabidopsis croatica, and Arabidopsis pedemontana) together with Arabidopsis cebennensis, and (iii) centers of genetic and morphological diversity are mostly in congruence and are located close to the Balkans in Austria and Slovakia outside glaciated and permafrost regions with few notable exceptions.},

(Cruciferae) var. arcuata, despite larvae not being able to survive on it, suggesting it may have potential as a trap crop. In a no-choice greenhouse experiment, P. xylostella laid 28\% more eggs on B. vulgaris than on cabbage. Within the B. vulgaris plant, P. xylostella laid 3.7 times more eggs on younger than older leaves. Furthermore, we demonstrated that in the presence of B. vulgaris volatiles, P. xylostella laid 23\% more eggs on cabbage plants than when B. vulgaris volatiles were absent. Because increased oogenesis in the presence of B. vulgaris could complicate the use of this host as a trap crop for P. xylostella, we wanted to examine levels of oogenesis in varying mixtures of cabbage and B. vulgaris. In outdoor screenhouse experiments, P. xylostella laid a decreasing percentage of eggs on cabbage as the percentage of B. vulgaris increased. However, the total number of eggs laid on cabbage did not differ among treatments, suggesting that the presence of B. vulgaris may have stimulated P. xylostella oviposition. In the field, total oviposition in cabbage plots containing B. vulgaris was 6.3 times higher than in cabbage plots without B. vulgaris. However, in plots with B. vulgaris, P. xylostella laid 99\% of the eggs on B. vulgaris and oviposition on cabbage plants was 6.2 times lower than in the plots without B. vulgaris. The results of this study are discussed according to P. xylostella egg-laying behavior and life history as it relates to its interaction with B. vulgaris.},

	abstract = {Aim To test whether congeneric species are significantly associated with one another in space, either positively or negatively. Also, to provide a framework for a causal investigation of co-occurrence patterns by a parallel comparison of interactions in geographical and ecological data matrices. Location For the analysis of congeneric species’ co-occurrences we used 30 matrices covering a wide range of taxa and geographical areas, while for the causal investigation we used the distribution of 50 terrestrial isopod species on 20 islands and 264 sampling stations in the central Aegean archipelago, as well as a number of ecological variables for each sampling station. Methods We developed a software program (cooc) that incorporates the species-by-species approach to co-occurrence analysis using EcoSim's output of prior null model analysis of co-occurrence. We describe this program in detail, and use it to investigate one of the most common assembly rules, namely, the decreased levels of co-occurrence among congeneric species pairs. For the causal analysis, we proceed likewise, cross-checking the results from the geographical and the ecological matrices. There is only one possible combination of results that can support claims for direct competition among species. Results We do not get any strong evidence for widespread competition among congeneric species, while most communities investigated do not show significant patterns of species associations. The causal analysis suggests that the principal factors behind terrestrial isopod species associations are of historical nature. Some exceptional cases are also discussed. Main conclusions Presence/absence data for a variety of taxa do not support the assembly rule that congeneric species are under more intense competition compared to less related species. Also, these same data do not suggest strong interactions among species pairs, regardless of taxonomic status. When significant species associations can be seen in such matrices, they mainly reflect the effects of history or of habitat requirements.},

The first appearance of D. pastinacella on P. sativa in New Zealand in 2004 provided an opportunity to quantify selective impacts of a coevolved herbivore and calibrate rates of phytochemical response in its host plant. Webworms in 2006 reduced seed production up to 75\% in New Zealand populations, and in 2007 infestations increased in severity in all populations except one. Most New Zealand populations fall into a furanocoumarin phenotype cluster distinct from European and U.S. phenotypes, although one heavily attacked population clusters with two U.S. populations and one European population long associated with webworms. Multivariate selection analysis substituting realized fitness (with webworms present) for potential fitness (absent webworms) as the dependent variable revealed that reassociation with a coevolved specialist in a nonindigenous area profoundly altered the selection regime, favoring trait remixing and rapid chemical changes in parsnip populations, as predicted by the geographic mosaic theory. That uninfested populations of New Zealand parsnips contain higher amounts of octyl acetate, a floral volatile used by webworms for orientation, suggests that plants that escape from specialized enemies may also experience selection to increase kairomones, as well as to reduce allomones.},

	abstract = {Inducible plant resistance against herbivores is becoming a paradigm of plant–herbivore ecology. Fundamental to understanding induced resistance and its evolutionary ecology is specificity of “induction” and “effects”. Specificity in the induction of resistance refers to whether plant damage by various herbivores causes the same response in plants. Specificity in the effects of induced resistance refers to whether induction has the same consequences (i.e., reduced preference or performance) for various herbivores. I examined both specificity of induction and effect employing four lepidopteran herbivores and wild radish plants, a system for which fitness benefits and costs of induction have been documented for the plant. Variation in the specificity of induction and effects of induced plant resistance was found; however, this variation was not associated with diet specialization in the herbivores (i.e., specialists vs generalists). Induction caused by Plutella (specialist) and Spodoptera (generalist) resulted in general resistance to all of the herbivores, induction caused by Pieris (specialist) induced resistance only to Spodoptera (generalist) and Pieris, and plant damage by Trichoplusia (generalist) failed to induce resistance and reduce the performance of any of the herbivores. To the contrary, plants damaged by Trichoplusia supported enhanced growth of subsequently feeding Trichoplusia compared to uninduced controls. These results add a novel level of complexity to interactions between plants and leaf chewing caterpillars. Within the same guild of feeders, some herbivores cause strong induced resistance, no induced resistance, or induced susceptibility. Similarly, caterpillar species were variable in the level to which induced resistance affected their performance. Such interactions limit the possibility of pairwise coevolution between plants and herbivores, and suggest that coevolution can only be diffuse.},

A model for individual sapling growth considering both inter- and intraspecific competition was developed. The effect of species-specific crown shape on the sapling growth and competition of the two species were examined.Picea jezoensisandAbies sachalinensissaplings had deep conic and shallow flat crowns, respectively.Picea jezoensishad more foliage mass thanAbies sachalinensisof the same sapling mass. It was suggested that thePicea jezoensissapling has a high cost for assimilation–respiration balance under dark conditions of closed canopies, whereas theAbies sachalinensissapling maintains effective assimilation even under suppressed conditions. Widely spaced saplings, such as gap successors, ofPicea jezoensishad a greater relative growth rate (a0) than widely spacedAbies sachalinensis. The crown shape of saplings of the two species shows different adaptations for efficient persistence in the sub-boreal forest. Saplings ofPicea jezoensisandAbies sachalinensiswere not uniformly distributed, but aggregated in different sites as the saplings grew, indicating habitat segregation between the two species at the sapling stage. Intraspecific sapling competition was one-sided in each of the two conifers. Interspecific sapling competition was one-sided in the direction only fromAbies sachalinensistoPicea jezoensis. Therefore, asymmetric competition prevailed at the sapling stage of the two species. These results contrast with weak symmetric competition or the almost absence of competition between trees (≥2m in height) of the two species (Kubota and Hara,Annals of Botany76: 503–512, 1995). The mode of competition changed with the life-history stage from the sapling (intense and asymmetric) to the tree (weak and symmetric or almost absent). In conclusion (1) asymmetric and intense competition between saplings brought about habitat segregation between the dominant species,Picea jezoensisandAbies sachalinensis, in the early stage of life-history; (2) therefore, the coexistence ofPicea jezoensisandAbies sachalinensisof the sub-boreal forest was determined by the boundary conditions for the growth dynamics of the trees, as segregation of establishment sites resulting from asymmetric and intense competition between saplings; (3) then the species composition of the forest was maintained by weak symmetric competition or the almost absence of competition between trees.},

	abstract = {SYNOPSIS. The geographical distribution of animals is affected by both historical and present-day ecological factors. It is of great interest to distinguish between their effects. Unfortunately, both major classes of factors can yield similar biogeographic patterns, making it difficult to know which factor is more important. In addition, it is very important to examine all of the consequences of a particular hypothesis, as well as alternatives. Two examples are given: the Pleistocene forest refuge hypothesis and vicariance biogeography. The refuge hypothesis yields three predictions, but only one is upheld—concordance of centers of diversity; the distribution of positions and widths of contact zones is inconsistent with the hypothesis. The two alternative hypotheses, current ecology and current peripheral isolation, yield predictions which are upheld. The major prediction of vicariance biogeography, that concordant cladograms should indicate common vicariant sequences among the lineages, is rejected. Concordant cladograms can only result from common patterns of shared selection regimes and thus do not reflect vicariant patterns. More work needs to be done in distinguishing historical from ecological factors in species distributions.},

However, its underlying mechanisms are not sufficiently understood, particularly for insect species. Thus, we aimed to interpret the behavioral mechanism of edge effects in two cicada species: Graptopsaltria nigrofuscata (Motschulsky) and Cryptotympana facialis (Walker) (Hemiptera: Cicadidae). In recent decades, the G. nigrofuscata has been decreasing in urban environments, whereas C. facialis has not. We compared the predation pressure by birds in four urban and three suburban habitats and we observed predation-avoidance behaviors. Results showed that the G. nigrofuscata incurred extremely high predation pressure. However, in C. facialis, predation pressure was constant among habitats. Behavioral observations revealed that predation avoidance of G. nigrofuscata was highly cover dependent, because threatened individuals hid in nearby trees. When tree cover is highly fragmented, the G. nigrofuscata probably has difficulty hiding. However, C. facialis fled cover independently. From these results, we concluded that the main causes of the decline of G. nigrofuscata in urban habitats were its cover dependence and the increasing discontinuity of tree coverage.},

	abstract = {When multiple victim species (e.g. prey, host) are attacked by one or more shared enemy species (e.g. predator, pathogen), the potential exists for apparent competition between victim populations. We review ideas on apparent competition (also called "competition for enemy-free space") and sketch illustrative examples. One puzzling aspect of this indirect interaction is the repeated rediscovery of the essential ideas. Apparent competition arises between focal and alternative prey populations because, in the long term, enemy abundance depends on total prey availability; by increasing enemy numbers, alternative prey intensify predation on focal prey. A frequent empirical finding, consistent with theory, is exclusion of victim species from local communities by resident enemies. Theory suggests victim-species coexistence depends on particular conditions. To understand fully the consequences of shared enemies requires a body of contingent theory, specifying the time-scale of the interactions (short- and long-term consequences of sharing enemies generally differ), the structure of the food-web encompassing the interactions, its spatial context, etc. The "core criterion" for a focal victim species to invade a community supporting a resident, polyphagous enemy is r {\textbackslash}textgreater aP (the invader's intrinsic rate of increase should exceed attack rate times average enemy abundance). A growing body of data and observations test, and support, this prediction.},

Aerial tissues of cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) are populated by several morphologically distinct trichome types, the most abundant of which is the type VI glandular trichome that produces various specialized metabolites. Here, the effect of the hairless (hl) mutation on trichome density and morphology, chemical composition, and resistance to a natural insect herbivore of tomato was investigated. The results show that the major effect of hl on pubescence results from structural distortion (bending and swelling) of all trichome types in aerial tissues. Leaf surface extracts and isolated type VI glands from hl plants contained wild-type levels of monoterpenes, glycoalkaloids, and acyl sugars, but were deficient in sesquiterpene and polyphenolic compounds implicated in anti-insect defence. No-choice bioassays showed that hl plants are compromised in resistance to the specialist herbivore Manduca sexta. These results establish a link between the morphology and chemical composition of glandular trichomes in cultivated tomato, and show that hl-mediated changes in these leaf surface traits correlate with decreased resistance to insect herbivory.},

	abstract = {Plant defence against any type of stress may involve resistance (traits that reduce damage) or tolerance (traits that reduce the negative fitness impacts of damage). These two strategies have been proposed as redundant evolutionary alternatives. A late-season frost enabled us to estimate natural selection and genetic constraints on the evolution of frost resistance and tolerance in a wild plant species. We employed a genetic selection analysis (which is unbiased by environmental correlations between traits and fitness) on 75 paternal half-sibling families of annual wild radish [Raphanus raphanistrum (Brassicaceae)]. In an experimental population in southern Ontario, we found strong selection favouring plant resistance to frost, but selection against tolerance to frost. The selection against tolerance may have been caused by a cost of tolerance, as we provide evidence for a negative genetic correlation between tolerance and fitness in the absence of frost damage. Although we found no evidence for the theoretically predicted trade-off between frost tolerance and resistance among our families, we did detect negative correlational selection acting on the two traits, indicating that natural selection favoured high resistance combined with low tolerance and low resistance coupled with high tolerance, but not high or low levels of both traits together. There were few genetic correlations between the measured traits overall, but frost tolerance was negatively correlated with initial seed mass, and frost resistance was positively correlated with resistance to insect herbivory. Periodic episodes of strong selection such as that caused by the late-season frost may be disproportionately important in evolution, and are likely becoming more common because of human alterations of the environment.},

	abstract = {The defensive mechanisms of the wild potato, solanum berthaultii Hawkes, to larvae of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), were studied by selective removal of glandular trichomes and trichome exudates from leaflets, and by comparing performance on S. berthaultii and on the cultivated potato, S. tuberosum L., which lacks defensively active type A and B glandular trichomes. Removal of type A trichomes increased the proportion of larvae that fed on S. berthaultii. Removal of the exudate from type B trichomes increased the proportion of larvae that fed and led to a decrease in mortality. The predominant active compounds in type B exudate, i.e. fatty acid esters of sucrose, were only effective in the presence of type A trichomes. Sucrose esters did not affect larval feeding on S. tuberosum leaflets or on S. berthaultii leaf discs from which the type A trichomes had been removed. Growth of surviving larvae was not significantly affected by removing type A trichomes or type B exudate. Growth of larvae was significantly increased when S. berthaultii leaflets were presented in artificial diet which eliminated the physical barrier of the type B stalks. Growth was no different on artificial diet containing either S. berthaultii or S. tuberosum leaf material (fresh or lyophilized powder) but was poorer on these diets than on S. tuberosum leaflets. The presence of type A trichomes is a fundamental requirement for expression of S. berthaultii resistance to L1 L. decemlineata. Type B droplets containing sucrose esters increase the expression of resistance in the presence of defensively-active type A trichomes.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Where does a local adaptation take place? In general, an adaptive divergence is predicted to occur between isolated populations because gene flow will erode and prevent the divergence. Therefore, previous genome-wide studies that aim to find the adaptive genes have compared populations that are usually tens of hundreds of kilometers apart. However, because nearby populations are likely to be genetically connected or connected until recently, most of the genome should be undifferentiated, leaving the genetic footprints of natural selections more pronounced. Thus, if an adaptive divergence is to be found within a small spatial scale, such case may favor the screening for the adaptive genes. Here, we took advantage of a unique small-scale local adaptation in Arabidopsis halleri subsp. gemmifera, where similar phenotypic differentiation is found across an altitudinal cline on two distinct mountains. By scanning the genome with a focus on the presence of unidirectional allele frequency shift along the altitudes, we successfully obtained genes with functions that were in line with the known phenotypic and environmental difference between altitudes. Our approach is applicable to any species that show microgeographic divergence and should help understand the genetic basis of small-scale evolution.},

I discuss here the situations in which animals, particularly predators, may maximize their feeding efficiency by behaving in ways that result in frequency-dependent selection of their food. These include cases in which different types of prey occupy different ecological niches, those in which there are benefits or costs to mixed diets for the predator, those in which rarer types of prey provide easier targets, those in which the different types of prey provide unequal benefits to the animal eating them, those in which direct comparison of the benefits is possible, those in which sampling is necessary because the benefits are unknown, and Batesian and other mimicries. Frequency-dependent selection of food is likely to be common and widespread: to assume frequency independence, without testing, may often be misleading.},

The Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain physiographic region has the second highest level of endemism in the continental USA, but habitat fragmentation and land use changes have resulted in catastrophic population declines for many species. Astragalus michauxii (Fabaceae) is an herbaceous plant endemic to the region that is considered vulnerable to extinction, with populations generally consisting of fewer than 20 individuals. We developed eight polymorphic microsatellites and genotyped 355 individuals from 24 populations. We characterized the population genetic diversity and structure, tested for evidence of past bottlenecks, and identified evidence of contemporary gene flow between populations. The mean ratios of the number of alleles to the allelic range (M ratio) across loci for A. michauxii populations were well below the threshold of 0.68 identified as indicative of a past genetic bottleneck. Genetic diversity estimates were similar across regions and populations, and comparable to other long-lived perennial species. Within-population genetic variation accounted for 92 \% of the total genetic variation found in the species. Finally, there is evidence for contemporary gene flow among the populations in North Carolina. Although genetic factors can threaten rare species, maintaining habitats through prescribed burning, in concert with other interventions such as population augmentation or (re)introduction, are likely most critical to the long term survival of A. michauxii.},

Community ecologists have recognized that behavior influences ecological outcomes. For example, behavior contributes to the effect of history on community assembly, to indirect effects in predator–prey interactions, and to the responses of populations to human disturbance. More generally, behavior is often the source of context dependence; behavioral responses in different conditions lead to different ecological outcomes.

Accordingly, rates of egg maturation may be dependent on the quality and quantity of available food sources. In turn, oviposition behavior could be affected by diet quality via changes in egg load (number of mature eggs carried by a female). Experiments were conducted to determine whether adult feeding may affect oviposition behavior of the glassy-winged sharpshooter, Homalodisca vitripennis. No-choice tests demonstrated that eggs accumulated in glassy-winged sharpshooter abdomens as time since last oviposition increased largely as a function of feeding plant species. In choice tests, glassy-winged sharpshooter females were observed most frequently on the plant species that imparted the greatest egg maturation rate in no-choice tests. Direct tests of the effects of egg load on glassy-winged sharpshooter oviposition behavior found that females were more likely to deposit eggs as egg load increased. Similarly, acceptance of a low-ranked oviposition plant species by female glassy-winged sharpshooters increased with egg load and time since last oviposition. The results indicate that adult feeding affected glassy-winged sharpshooter egg maturation, plant species varied in quality for providing nutrients for egg maturation, and egg load affected oviposition behavior. Thus, the quantity and quality of available feeding plant species may affect glassy-winged sharpshooter egg maturation rates, which in turn may affect the plant species female glassy-winged sharpshooters select for oviposition.},

We use a predictive hypothesis-driven approach to quantify the relative contribution of historic and contemporary processes to genetic connectivity. By confronting genetic data with models of historic and contemporary landscapes, we identify dispersal processes operating in naturally heterogeneous and human-altered systems. We demonstrate the approach using a case study of microsatellite polymorphism and indirect estimates of gene flow for a rainforest bird, the logrunner (Orthonyx temminckii). Of particular interest was how much information in the genetic data was attributable to processes occurring in the reconstructed historic landscape and contemporary human-modified landscape. A linear mixed model was used to estimate appropriate sampling variance from nonindependent data and information-theoretic model selection provided strength of evidence for alternative hypotheses. The contemporary landscape explained slightly more information in the genetic differentiation data than the historic landscape, and there was considerable evidence for a temporal shift in dispersal pattern. In contrast, migration rates estimated from genealogical information were primarily influenced by contemporary landscape change. We discovered that landscape heterogeneity facilitated gene flow before European settlement, but contemporary deforestation is rapidly becoming the most important barrier to logrunner dispersal.},

	abstract = {Plant shading is commonly recognised as a factor, which increases susceptibility of plants to attack by herbivorous insects. In this study we experimentally investigated the effect of host plant shading on two willow-feeding leaf beetles, Galerucella lineola feeding upon Salix phylicifolia and Phratora vitellinae feeding upon Salix myrsinifolia. Both beetle species were more abundant on potted willows growing in open habitats than on the same clones placed under the shade of trees. However, in the laboratory the food preference by adults and larval performance showed that the shaded willows are actually better food for both beetle species. On the contrary, when larvae were reared in the field under natural abiotic conditions, we found no difference in larval performance, or if any, even better performance in open habitats. Apparently, higher and more variable daily temperatures in open habitats accelerated the growth of the larvae. When adults were let to emigrate from or immigrate to potted willows, which had been grown in the same conditions but placed either in the open or shady habitats, adults preferred exposed willows. Invertebrate predators were more abundant in open habitats, but we found no differences in leaf beetle mortality by natural enemies between the habitats. Although the larval performance appeared to be approximately equal in the two habitats during the unusually warm study period, we suggest that under suboptimal temperatures the better abiotic conditions of open sites can easily override the better food provided by shaded habitats. The selection of abiotic habitat thus plays a significant role in the adaptive habitat and host plant selection of these beetles within the gradient of shadiness.},

In applications the typical accompanying assumptions are those of a normally distributed error and an identity link. These assumptions are unnecessarily restrictive. Introduction of multiplicative terms for interaction in generalized linear models removes these restrictions. Parameter estimates can be obtained by an iterative process of alternating generalized row and column regressions within a quasi-likelihood set-up. The best known examples of this class of generalized additive main effects and multiplicative interaction effects (GAMMI) models are the AMMI models (Gauch, 1988, Biometrics 44, 705-715) and Goodman's RC-association models (Goodman, 1981, Journal of the American Statistical Association 76, 320-334). The multiplicative interaction part of GAMMI models can be visualized through biplots. Two applications of GAMMI models are presented for data coming from plant breeding experiments. The first illustration deals with a log-bilinear model for count data with (extra) Poisson variation. The second illustration concerns a logit-bilinear model for disease incidence data with a special type of variance function, an extension of a model presented by Wedderburn (1974, Biometrika 61, 439-447).},

While interactions between species and genotypes can also result in positive frequency dependence, positive frequency dependence has usually been credited with hastening the extinction of rare types and is not thought to contribute to coexistence. In the present paper, we develop a stochastic cellular automata model that allows us to vary the scale of frequency dependence and the scale of dispersal. The results of this model indicate that positive frequency dependence will allow the coexistence of two species at a greater rate than would be expected from chance. This coexistence arises from the generation of banding patterns that will be stable over long time–periods. As a result, we found that positive frequency–dependent interactions over local spatial scales promote coexistence over neutral interactions. This result was robust to variation in boundary conditions within the simulation and to variation in levels of disturbance. Under all conditions, coexistence is enhanced as the strength of positive frequency–dependent interactions is increased.},

Ecologists have delineated many mechanisms that can, in principle, favor species coexistence and hence maintain biodiversity. Most such coexistence mechanisms require or imply tradeoffs between different aspects of species performance. However, it remains unknown whether simple functional tradeoffs underlie coexistence mechanisms in diverse natural systems. We show that functional tradeoffs explain species differences in long-term population dynamics that are associated with recovery from low density (and hence coexistence) for a community of winter annual plants in the Sonoran Desert. We develop a new general framework for quantifying the magnitude of coexistence via the storage effect and use this framework to assess the strength of the storage effect in the winter annual community. We then combine a 25-year record of vital rates with morphological and physiological measurements to identify functional differences between species in the growth and reproductive phase of the life cycle that promote storage-effect coexistence. Separation of species along a tradeoff between growth capacity and low-resource tolerance corresponds to differences in demographic responses to environmental variation across years. Growing season precipitation is one critical environmental variable underlying the demographic decoupling of species. These results demonstrate how partially decoupled population dynamics that promote local biodiversity are associated with physiological differences in resource uptake and allocation between species. These results for a relatively simple system demonstrate how long-term community dynamics relate to functional biology, a linkage scientists have long sought for more complex systems.},

However, communities can be structured by a combination of both local and regional processes and to date, few community genetics studies have examined whether the effects of instraspecific genetic variation are consistent across levels of diversity. In this study, we ask whether host-plant genetic variation structures communities of arthropod inquilines within distinct habitat patches – rosette leaf galls on tall goldenrod (Solidago altissima). We found that genetic variation determined inquiline diversity at both local and regional spatial scales, but that trophic-level responses varied independently of one another. This result suggests that herbivores and predators likely respond to heritable plant traits at different spatial scales. Together, our results show that incorporating spatial scale is essential for predicting the effects of genetically variable traits on different trophic levels and levels of diversity within the communities that depend on host plants.},

Non-glandular trichomes are specialized unicellular or multicellular structures that occur in many different plant species and function in xenobiotic detoxification and protecting the plant against pest attack. By analysing the susceptibility of trichome mutants, evidence is provided that indicates the influence of leaf trichomes on foliar fungal infections in Arabidopsis thaliana, probably by facilitating the adhesion of the fungal spores/hyphae to the leaf surface. A decreased trichome number in the hairless Arabidopsis mutant gl1 enhances tolerance against the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea. By contrast, the try mutant shows an increased susceptibility to both fungal infection and accumulation. Trichome density does not influence infection by the soil-borne pathogen Rhizoctonia solani. In addition, the influence of trichomes on foliar infection is supported by targeting the high-level expression of the Trichoderma harzianum α-1,3-glucanase protein to the specialized cell structures. Trichome expression of this anti-fungal hydrolase shows a significant resistance to infection by the foliar pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Resistance to this fungus is not dependent on the constitutive induction of the salicylic or jasmonic defence signalling pathways, but the presence of the α-1,3-glucanase protein in trichomes.},

To ensure a correct initiation of critical developmental processes, such as the initiation and cessation of growth, plants have adapted to a spatially variable light regime and genes in the photoperiodic pathway have been implicated as likely sources for these adaptations. Here we examine genetic variation in genes from the photoperiodic pathway in Populus tremula (Salicaceae) for signatures diversifying selection in response to varying light regimes across a latitudinal gradient. We fail to identify any loci with unusually high levels of genetic differentiation among populations despite identifying four SNPs that show significant allele frequency clines with latitude. We do, however, observe large covariance in allelic effects across populations for growth cessation, a highly adaptive trait in P. tremula. High covariance in allelic effects is a signature compatible with diversifying selection along an environmental gradient. We also observe significantly higher heterogeneity in genetic differentiation among SNPs from the photoperiod genes than among SNPs from randomly chosen genes. This suggests that spatially variable selection could be affecting genes from the photoperiod pathway even if selection is not strong enough to cause individual loci to be identified as outliers. SNPs from three genes in the photoperiod pathway (PHYB2, LHY1, and LHY2) show significant associations with natural variation in growth cessation. Collectively these SNPs explain 10–15\% of the phenotypic variation in growth cessation. Covariances in allelic effects across populations help explain an additional 5–7\% of the phenotypic variation in growth cessation.},

	url = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1433831904700232},
	abstract = {The majority of species of flowering plants rely on pollination by insects, so that their reproductive success and in part their population structure are determined by insect behaviour. The foraging behaviour of insect pollinators is flexible and complex, because efficient collection of nectar or pollen is no simple matter. Each flower provides a variable but generally small reward that is often hidden, flowers are patchily distributed in time and space, and are erratically depleted of rewards by other foragers. Insects that specialise in visiting flowers have evolved an array of foraging strategies that act to improve their efficiency, which in turn determine the reproductive success of the plants that they visit. This review attempts a synthesis of the recent literature on selectivity in pollinator foraging behaviour, in terms of the species, patch and individual flowers that they choose to visit. The variable nature of floral resources necessitate foraging behaviour based upon flexible learning, so that foragers can respond to the pattern of rewards that they encounter. Fidelity to particular species allows foragers to learn appropriate handling skills and so reduce handling times, but may also be favoured by use of a search image to detect flowers. The rewards received are also used to determine the spatial patterns of searches; distance and direction of flights are adjusted so that foragers tend to remain within rewarding patches and depart swiftly from unrewarding ones. The distribution of foragers among patchy resources generally conforms to the expectations of two simple optimal foraging models, the ideal free distribution and the marginal value theorem. Insects are able to learn to discriminate among flowers of their preferred species on the basis of subtle differences in floral morphology. They may discriminate upon the basis of flower size, age, sex or symmetry and so choose the more rewarding flowers. Some insects are also able to distinguish and reject depleted flowers on the basis of ephemeral odours left by previous visitors. These odours have recently been implicated as a mechanism involved in interspecific interactions between foragers. From the point of view of a plant reliant upon insect pollination, the behaviour of its pollinators (and hence its reproductive success) is likely to vary according to the rewards offered, the size and complexity of floral displays used to advertise their location, the distribution of conspecific and of rewards offered by other plant species, and the abundance and behaviour of other flower visitors.},

	abstract = {Resistance and tolerance represent two general strategies of plant defence against herbivores. Since resources available for allocation to defence are limited and resistance and tolerance are likely to serve the same functions for plants, the occurrence of trade offs between these two strategies has been assumed. We review the empirical evidence for tolerance–resistance tradeoffs by means of meta-analysis of genetic correlations between resistance and tolerance obtained from 31 ecological and agricultural studies published during 1980–2003 and conducted on 17 different plant species. The sign of the relationship between tolerance and resistance differed depending on the type of plants examined. Tolerance and resistance tended to be positively correlated in crops and negatively correlated in wild plants, but the mean correlation coefficients in both plant types were not significantly different from zero. The magnitude of correlations was affected neither by the tolerance measure (reduction in growth or in fitness in damaged plants) nor by the resistance measure used (inverse of damage, antibiosis, antixenosis, or specific resistance trait). In wild plants correlations between resistance and tolerance were significantly negative (r=−0.069) only in studies where resistance was assessed as a specific chemical or mechanical resistance trait, but this correlation is based only on two studies. No difference in the mean resistance–tolerance correlations was found between studies conducted in the field and in the greenhouse; in both cases mean correlations tended to be positive. The results of our analysis indicate that conditions under which a negative association between resistance and tolerance occurs and, thus, the evolution of multiple defensive strategies in plants is constrained, are much more restrictive than previously assumed. However, the currently available studies are still scarce and taxonomically skewed to allow a thorough analysis of sources of variation in resistance–tolerance relationship. Specifically, we need more studies examining the relationship between specific resistance and tolerance traits, studies on perennial plants and under different environmental conditions.},

The purpose of this study was to determine if lines of a rapid-cycling Brassica rapa (L.) that had been artificially selected for quantitative differences in foliar glucosinolate content also differed in their realized defense, defined as the number of eggs laid on or level of damage incurred by a plant when exposed to herbivores. I asked whether defense was conferred at the oviposition or feeding stage, whether 2 herbivore species respond similarly to different foliar glucosinolate concentrations, and whether these same 2 species could impose selection in different directions on foliar glucosinolate concentration. I used an oligophagous herbivore, Pieris rapae (L.), and a polyphagous herbivore, Trichoplusia ni Hübner. Feeding was examined for both herbivore species, and oviposition was examined for P. rapae. P. rapae adult females did not favor any single selection line over another as a site for oviposition. However, P. rapae larvae did remove greater amounts of leaf area on plants from lines selected for low glucosinolate content when given a choice. In addition, T. ni larvae caused significantly greater amounts of damage on low glucosinolate line plants. Thus, quantitative variation in glucosinolate content among selected lines does confer differences in realized defense against these 2 herbivores. However, because P. rapae adult females do not appear to discriminate among plants that differ in glucosinolate content, defense is conferred at the level of feeding. Further, in contrast to previous studies, larvae of both the polyphagous and the oligophagous herbivore species responded similarly to quantitative variation in secondary compounds, causing more damage on low glucosinolate lines. This parallel response suggests that both herbivore species should impose selection on defense in the same direction in B. rapa for increased levels of glucosinolate production.},

	abstract = {Trichomes occur in a multitude of forms and sizes. Although they have been used widely for taxonomic purposes, their adaptive significance has been all but ignored by the evolutionist and ecologist. It is clear that trichomes play a role in plant defense, especially with regard to phytophagous insects. In numerous species there is a negative correlation between trichome density and insect feeding and oviposition responses, and the nutrition of larvae. Specialized hooked trichomes may impale adults or larvae as well. Trichome may also complement the chemical defense of a plant by possessing glands which exude terpenes, phenolics, alkaloids or other substances which are olfactory or gustatory repellents. In essence, glandular trichomes afford an outer line of chemical defense by advertising the presence of "noxious" compounds. In some groups of plants, protection against large mammals is achieved by the presence of stinging trichomes. Intraspecific variation for trichome type and density is known in many species, and often is clinal in accordance with ecographic parameters. The presence of such correlations does not imply that differences in predator pressure are the causal factors, although this may indeed be the case.},

	abstract = {The functional response is one of the most widely measured attributes of consumers. Phenomenalistic descriptions of how predator attack rates vary with prey density are fundamental components of consumer-resource models. The application of these functions typically assumes continuous foraging by individuals, along with stationarity in their behavioural and physiological processes. Yet most species display a diurnal cycle in foraging and resting, and the impact of this foraging pattern on the functional response is unknown.We use a physiologically structured or ‘state–space’ approach to examine how the daily foraging cycle affects the temporal dynamics of attack rates and the functional response of parasitoids (Aphytis melinus) and predators (Mantis crassulea and fishes). The state spaces for parasitoids and predators are the number of mature eggs, the eggload, and the satiation level, respectively. The corresponding rates are those of egg maturation and oviposition on one hand, and digestion and prey capture on the other hand.We show that the length of the foraging period alters both the shape of the functional response and the magnitude of attack rates, compared to a daily functional response proportional to the time spent foraging, as is classically done. Our models reveal how separation of time-scales arises between behavioural or physiological and lifetime processes, and the difficulty in resolving such separation once the new time scale of a foraging cycle is introduced.Foragers in many environments, either because of exposure to low resource density or constrained by short foraging windows, cannot achieve the behavioural or physiological stationarity assumed in classical analyses. This introduces a fundamental mixture of time-scales that has significant effects on estimates of attack rates. Using a population-level model of predators and prey, we show how restricted periods of daily foraging have important dynamical consequences both in terms of equilibrium levels and return times to these equilibria.},

	abstract = {Many species of nonmodel deceptively pollinated orchids are polymorphic for corolla color. These species are pollinated by naive insects searching for nectar, and are not mimics. It has been suggested that the foraging behavior of insect pollinators during the avoidance learning process results in these stable corolla color polymorphisms; for this to occur pollinators must induce negative frequency-dependent selection on corolla color. Therefore the hypothesis that pollinator behavior results in a preference for rare color morphs of deceptive species was tested experimentally. Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) foraged in the laboratory on arrays of artificial flowers with different corolla color morphs. Morphs were varied in frequency, and bumblebee preferences were recorded on arrays where morphs did and did not contain sucrose solution rewards. Bumblebees preferred the most common color morph when flowers contained sucrose solution rewards, but overvisited rare morphs when sampling flowers that contained no rewards. Bumblebees also tended to move between unlike color morphs when these were unrewarding, suggesting that a probabilistic sampling strategy was adopted. Thus experiments demonstrated that pollinator behavior could result in a selective advantage for rare color morphs of plant species that are pollinated by deception without mimicry, which would induce negative frequency-dependent selection on corolla color. The observed pollinator behavior could allow stable corolla color polymorphisms to be maintained by selection in nonmodel deceptively pollinated species.},

A positive correlation between oviposition preference and offspring performance of B. tryoni was observed in the three tomato cultivars. Grosse Lisse and Roma cultivars were highly preferred by B. tryoni over Cherry cultivar. Performance (measured as proportion of eggs developing to the pupal stage) was significantly higher in Grosse Lisse and Roma cultivars than in Cherry cultivar. The pericarp toughness of Cherry cultivar appears responsible for its low rate of infestation, while the presence of 2-butanol and 1,4-butanediamine in Roma and Grosse Lisse, respectively, may partly be responsible for the high oviposition preference shown by B. tryoni towards these cultivars.},

	abstract = {Abstract. 1. Although both genotype and induced responses affect a plant's resistance to herbivores, little is known about their relative and interactive effects. This study examined how plant genotype of a native plant (Oenothera biennis) and induced plant responses to herbivory affect resistance to, and interactions among, several herbivores.2. In a field experiment, genetic and environmental variation among habitats led to variation in the amount of early season damage and plant quality. The pattern of variation in early season infestation by spittlebugs (Philaenus spumarius, a piercing–sucking herbivore) negatively correlated with oviposition preference by a later feeding specialist weevil (Tyloderma foveolatum, a leaf-chewer).3. To determine if plant genotype and induced responses to herbivory might be responsible for these field patterns, we performed no-choice and choice bioassays using four genotypes of O. biennis that varied in resistance. Plants were induced by either spittlebugs or weevils and assays measured the responses of the same specialist weevil as well as a generalist caterpillar (Spodoptera exigua).4. Resistance to adult weevils was largely unaffected by plant genotype, while they experienced induced resistance following damage by conspecific weevils in no-choice assays. Caterpillars were more strongly affected by plant genotype than induced responses in both no-choice and choice assays, but they also fed less and experienced higher mortality on plants previously damaged by weevils. In contrast to the pattern suggested by the field experiment, spittlebugs did consistently induce resistance against either weevils or caterpillars in the bioassay experiment.5. These results support recent findings that show herbivore species can compete via induced plant responses. Additionally, a quantitative review of the literature demonstrates that plant genotype tends to be more important than interspecific competition among herbivores (plant-mediated or otherwise) in affecting herbivore preference and performance.},

	abstract = {In paired-choice assays, two treatments are presented simultaneously to each subject. Data from such arrays should not be considered to be independent, and correct statistical analysis must account for the correlation. A statistical test that often is appropriate for these assays is the paired-sample t-test. I present curves showing the extent to which statistical power of this test is affected by sample size, effect size (i.e., magnitude of treatment differences), and correlation. For a given effect size and replication, positive correlation between paired observations substantially improves power of the test, whereas negative correlation reduces power. I conducted a literature survey of paired-choice assays to determine whether there are patterns in effect sizes and correlation that might assist in designing studies or in predicting minimum sample sizes necessary to achieve reasonable statistical power; experiments were categorized according to whether they were feeding or oviposition assays. The review indicated that correlation was highly variable and ranged between strongly negative and strongly positive values. Oviposition assays showed larger positive correlations than did feeding assays, resulting in larger effect sizes (adjusted for correlation); however, feeding assays tended to use larger sample sizes than oviposition assays, hence estimated statistical power was similar between the two types of assays. Oviposition assays often used multiple insects per arena, apparently sacrificing replication, whereas feeding assays tended to use a single insect per arena. Approximately 45\% of experiments failed to detect significant treatment effects. The majority of nonsignificant assays had too few replications to detect even a large effect size with a reasonable statistical power. Literature examples are presented to show that assay methodology (specifically number of insects per arena, distance between paired choices, and assay duration) can affect correlation, effect size, and statistical power. Finally, scatter plots of the data, although rarely presented, are shown to provide insight into methodological, statistical, and biological aspects of paired-choice assays.},

The evolutionary significance of flower-color polymorphisms found in many rewardless orchid species has been discussed at length, but the mechanisms responsible for their maintenance remain unclear. Laboratory experiments have suggested that behavioral responses by pollinators to lack of reward availability might result in a reproductive advantage for rare-color morphs. Consequently, we performed an experiment varying the relative frequency of the two color morphs of D. sambucina to test whether rare morph advantage acted in the natural habitat of the species. We show here clear evidence from this manipulative experiment that rare-color morphs have reproductive advantage through male and female components.

High toxin concentration in leaves and fruits inhibits consumption, while predation risk reduces feeding opportunities, as prey forage to avoid encountering predators. Thus, both factors vary and define the quality of the landscape. How foraging animals directly quantify, compare and respond to these two costs has rarely been tested.2. We show that free-ranging bushbabies – small, frugivorous primates – change their behaviour and use of artificial food patches based on the interplay between toxin concentration in food and patch safety. Using a titration experiment, we demonstrate that bushbabies quantify the relative costs of toxin and fear. We pinpoint where these costs are equivalent and show that animals seek food patches with the lower net cost.3. We conclude that the ecological effectiveness of plant toxins as defence against consumers needs to be considered in the context of a landscape of fear – and the relative impact of anti-predator tactics and plant defence is strongly shaped by the concentration of these defences.4. A corollary is that plants may benefit from fear as a substitute for their own chemical defence, adding a new dimension to the concept of indirect plant defence. Whether, from the plant’s perspective, the benefits derived from fear can be considered evolutionarily adaptive rather than simply ecologically serendipitous remains to be tested.},

	abstract = {1In order to investigate the use of plant functional types as an alternative to floristic descriptions of response to grazing, we analysed plant communities from a cattle grazing experiment conducted in grassy eucalypt woodland in subtropical Queensland, Australia. The two variables analysed (landscape position and stocking rate) accounted for similar proportions of variation in the vegetation ground layer, although forbs were more sensitive to slope position and perennial grasses were more sensitive to stocking rate.2As grazing pressure increased, perennial grasses declined, while the relative proportion of forbs and annual grasses increased. Detailed functional group analyses were conducted for the perennial grass and forb life-forms. Annual grasses were represented by only two species, preventing identification of functional types within this life-form.3We conducted a five-step analysis for both perennial grasses and forbs as follows: (i) defining grazing-related species response groups; (ii) defining species groups based on natural attribute correlations; (iii) identifying attributes that changed significantly with grazing; (iv) identifying syndromes by relating (ii) and (iii); (v) describing functional types from (iii) and (iv), and assessing them against actual species response.4Eight grass and eight forb functional types were identified. Of the taxa that had an observed response to grazing, 54\% of the grass taxa and 57\% of the forb taxa corresponded to one of these functional types in terms of meeting both grazing response and trait criteria. The five-stage analysis provided a comprehensive but complex approach to functional type identification.5The functional types identified can be summarized as follows. Low levels of grazing were associated with more medium-sized, moderately leafy perennial grasses with wind-dispersed or adhesive seeds, and more erect or twining forbs with large to medium sized seeds. High levels of grazing were associated with: more annual grasses; low-growing leafy perennial grasses with small seeds having no dispersal appendages; mat-forming large-seeded forbs; and low-growing, scrambling, small-seeded forbs.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary mechanisms causing intraspecific diversity in aposematic color and pattern remain enigmatic. The strawberry poison frog (Oophaga pumilio) has diversified into a broad array of colors that span the visible spectrum. The most divergent phenotypes of O. pumilio are restricted to separate islands in the Bocas del Toro archipelago in western Panama, whereas throughout the majority of its range (from Nicaragua to western Panama) this species exhibits a single red phenotype. During the Holocene, sea-levels increased and changes in climate caused shifts in habitat through time. In the Bocas del Toro archipelago, rising sea-levels isolated previously connected populations in higher elevation habitats (forming islands). In this study we use historic measures of demography, ancestral distribution estimates, spatiotemporally explicit demographic models and genetic simulations to investigate the genetic consequences of the isolation due to sea-level changes and demographic processes mediated by recent climatic fluctuations. We then evaluate the role of these factors in the evolution of color in O. pumilio by measuring and comparing the deep coalescence of a neutrally evolving nuclear gene and a hypothetical autosomal coloration gene. Our results support a major role for recent population expansion and reduced gene flow (from isolation on islands) in the diversification of color across populations.},

	abstract = {We quantified differences in leaf traits between upper and lower crowns of a deciduous oak, Quercus acutissima, and examined feeding preference, consumption and performance of the Japanese oak silkmoth, Antheraea yamamai, for those leaves. Upper-crown leaves had significantly smaller area, larger dry mass per area, greater thickness, lower water content, higher nitrogen content and a higher N/C ratio than lower-crown leaves. When simultaneously offered upper-crown and lower-crown leaves, moth larvae consumed a significantly larger amount of the former. However, when fed with either upper-crown or lower-crown leaves (no choice), they consumed a significantly larger amount of the latter. Female larvae reared on upper-crown leaves had a significantly smaller fresh weight, but attained a significantly larger pupal fresh and dry weight, with a significantly higher relative growth rate than those on lower-crown leaves. Although, like female larvae, male larvae had a significantly smaller fresh weight when reared on upper-crown leaves, they had a significantly larger value only for pupal dry weight. These results suggest that: (i) larvae ingest a greater amount of lower-crown leaves to compensate for the lower nitrogen content of the foliage, resulting in having an excess of water because of the higher water content of the foliage; (ii) feeding preference for upper-crown leaves accords with better performance (with respect to dry pupal weight and relative growth rate) on the foliage; (iii) better performance is explained by a higher nitrogen content and N/C ratio of the upper-crown foliage; and (iv) the effects of leaf quality on performance differ between sexes.},

	abstract = {The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coexistence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover.},

	abstract = {Beetles in the genus Tetraopes share a long evolutionary history with milkweeds (Asclepias spp.), feeding on roots as larvae and leaves as adults. Despite their extreme specialization on milkweed, Tetraopes require drying grass stems as oviposition sites, even though they do not consume grass. The natural history of the interaction suggests that herbivory may be likely only when milkweeds are in close proximity to grasses. Theory also predicts that two stresses on plants, competition and herbivory, may have non-additive negative impacts on correlates of fitness. In field experiments conducted over two years, I followed the consequences of grass competition and beetle attack for herbivory, growth, and reproduction of milkweed, and reciprocal effects of milkweed on grass in common gardens. To assess the effect of milkweed traits on beetles, I conducted a quantitative genetic experiment using full-sibling families of milkweed and measured the effects of putative resistance traits on the abundance of Tetraopes adults. Milkweeds growing next to grass were initially unaffected in growth but suffered 10\% greater leaf herbivory by adult Tetraopes than did milkweeds growing alone. This effect was caused by direct attraction of beetles to grass, not by a competitive modification of milkweed's phenotype. In late summer of the first growing season, when Tetraopes naturally oviposits, I experimentally added larvae to milkweed roots with and without grass competition. Within a month, I detected an interaction between competition and herbivory: neither had an individual impact, but jointly they reduced milkweed growth. In spring of the second growing season, when Tetraopes had completed development, I again found strong evidence for a non-additive effect of competition and herbivory together, severely reducing plant growth compared to their individual effects. Root herbivory induced a plant response that reduced the abundance of leaf-mining flies by 40\%, but only for milkweeds with grass competition. Neither competition nor herbivory affected the production of defensive latex, cardenolides, or carbon, but they interacted to affect leaf nitrogen content. Thus, although trait-mediated indirect interactions were implicated in the effect of competition and root herbivory on leaf miner abundance, I did not uncover the mechanism. In the final harvest, beetle herbivory reduced reproductive characters (fruit production, fruit mass, aboveground biomass) by 20– 30\%, whereas competition had negligible effects. The net interaction effect for grass was competitive, with a 23\% reduction in grass biomass caused by milkweed in the absence of herbivory. However, the presence of beetle herbivory on milkweed roots completely alleviated the competitive effect of milkweed on grass. Thus, the associational effect of grass on milkweed resulted in milkweed suffering the non-additive effects of competition and herbivory, whereas grass enjoyed competitive release by facilitating its neighbor's herbivore. Many traits of milkweed (e.g., growth, reproduction, and several resistance traits) showed variation among 23 full-sibling families, indicating that competitive ability and resistance may be subject to natural selection. A multiple regression analysis on family means revealed that leaf trichome density and nitrogen content were negatively genetically correlated with abundance of Tetraopes adults, but probability of flowering and plant height were positively associated. Leaf miners were most strongly negatively affected by latex and trichomes. Thus, complex interactions among competition, root herbivory, and plant genetic variation affect the herbivore and plant community and may result in diffuse coevolution between milkweed and its herbivores. I present a general model that predicts the conditions in which plant–plant interactions result in net competition or facilitation.},

In the present study, we used nuclear microsatellite markers to detect extant patterns of population genetic structure of the perennial plant Veratrum album ssp. oxysepalum in the understory of temperate forests, aiming to provide insights into the post-glacial history of the species and the reasons for the disjunct distribution of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) haplotypes found in a previous study. We examined eight polymorphic nuclear microsatellite loci to examine genetic variation within and among 32 populations of V. album ssp. oxysepalum and seven populations of Veratrum stamineum. The population of V. album ssp. oxysepalum was split into two groups: those in the northern part of the Japanese Archipelago and all others. In addition, each population group was split into two subgroups. Only one population of V. stamineum included a substantial number of individuals categorized as V. album ssp. oxysepalum. The population genetic structure revealed by nuclear microsatellites suggests that V. album ssp. oxysepalum migrated from Eurasia into the Japanese Archipelago at least twice before the last glacial era through two different land bridges: the Korean Peninsula and Sakhalin. In addition, there appeared to be at least two refugia of V. album ssp. oxysepalum in each of the areas, dominated by the two different lineages from Eurasia during the last glacial era. The disjunct geographical pattern found in cpDNA variation in a previous study was blurred in the genetic structure as revealed by microsatellite markers, probably as a result of extensive gene flow via pollen. Currently, one-directional introgressive hybridization occurs from V. album ssp. oxysepalum to V. stamineum at only one locality; there is no evidence of the opposite pattern. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2012, 108, 278–293.},

Much of the work on which the book is based was carried out by the authors in the USA and UK, and many of the species and communities discussed are of economic importance, including pests of crops and forest trees and potentially beneficial insects feeding on weeds (including bracken (Pteridium aquilinum)). The authors also draw on literature published up to the end of 1982. Chapters are devoted to the evolution of phytophagous insects; the major determinants of diversity; community patterns through time (the dynamics of colonisation and speciation); species interactions in communities (the animals) (including parasites and predators); interactions involving the plants; and coevolution. The synthetic, pattern-seeking approach to community ecology is combined with reductionist methods that isolate single mechanisms for study. It is considered that this publication will be suitable for senior undergraduates and research workers in the fields of entomology, ecology, agriculture and botany.},

Facilitative mechanisms may act simultaneously with resource competition or allelopathy, and the overall effect of one species on another may be the product of multiple, complex interactions. Positive interactions may also determine community spatial patterns, permit coexistence, enhance diversity and productivity, and drive community dynamics.

	abstract = {The maize orange leafhopper Cicadulina bipunctata is distributed widely in tropical and subtropical regions of the Old World and feeds on various Poaceae. The leafhopper is recognized as an important pest of maize in several countries. Adults as well as nymphs of C. bipunctata induce growth stunting and galls characterized by the severe swelling of leaf veins on many cereal crops including wheat, rice, and maize, but do not on barley. To clarify the mechanism of growth stunting and gall induction by C. bipunctata, we used six barley chromosome disomic addition lines of wheat (2H–7H) and investigated the effect of barley (cv. Betzes) chromosome addition on the susceptibility of wheat (cv. Chinese Spring) to feeding by the leafhopper. Feeding by C. bipunctata significantly stunted the growth in 2H, 3H, 4H, and 5H, but did not in 6H and 7H. The degree of gall induction was significantly weaker and severer in 3H and 5H than in Chinese Spring, respectively. These results suggest that barley genes resistant to growth stunting and gall induction exist in 6H and 7H, and 3H, respectively. 5H is considered to be useful for future assays investigating the mechanism of gall induction by this leafhopper because of the high susceptibility to the feeding by C. bipunctata. Significant correlation between the degrees of growth stunting and gall induction was not detected in the six chromosome addition lines and Chinese spring. This implies that these two symptoms are independent phenomena although both are initiated by the feeding of C. bipunctata.},

Amongst these, Hessian fly (HF), Russian wheat aphid (RWA), Sunn pest (SP), wheat stem saw fly (WSSF) and cereal leaf beetle (CLB) are the most damaging in the areas where they occur. Historically, the use of resistance genes in wheat has been the most effective, environmentally friendly, and cost-efficient approach to controlling pest infestations. In this study, we carried out a genome-wide association study with 2518 Diversity Arrays Technology markers which were polymorphic on 134 wheat genotypes with varying degrees of resistance to the five most destructive pests (HF, RWA, SP, WSSF and CLB) of wheat, using mixed linear model (MLM) analysis with population structure as a covariate. We identified 26 loci across the wheat genome linked to genes conferring resistance to these pests, of which 20 are potentially novel quantitative trait loci with significance values which ranged between 5 × 10−3 and 10−11. We used an in silico approach to identify probable candidate genes at some of the genomic regions and found that their functions varied from defense response with transferase activity to several genes of unknown function. Identification of potentially new loci associated with resistances to pests would contribute to more rapid marker-aided incorporation of new and diverse genes to develop new varieties with improved resistance against these pests.},

	abstract = {Crop domestication is the process of artificially selecting plants to increase their suitability to human tastes and cultivated growing conditions. There is increasing evidence that crop domestication can profoundly alter interactions among plants, herbivores, and their natural enemies. However, there are few generalizable predictions on how insect herbivores and natural enemies should respond to artificial selection of specific plant traits. We reviewed the literature to determine how different insect herbivore feeding guilds and natural enemy groups (parasitoids and predators) respond to existing variation in wild and cultivated plant populations for plant traits typically targeted by domestication. Our goal was to look for broad patterns in tritrophic interactions to generate support for a range of potential outcomes from human-mediated selection. Overall, we found that herbivores benefit from directional selection on traits that have been targeted by domestication, but the effects on natural enemies were less studied and less consistent. In general, herbivores appear to mirror human preferences for higher nutritional content and larger plant structures. In contrast, the general effect of lowered plant secondary metabolites did not always influence herbivores consistently. Given that crop domestication appears to be a transformative process that fundamentally alters insect–plant interactions, we believe that a more detailed understanding of the community-wide effects of crop domestication is needed to simultaneously stimulate both biological control and plant breeding efforts to enhance sustainable pest control.},

Over the last century, daily temperatures increased during 5 of the 8 months key to gametogenesis in frogs and toads near Ithaca, New York ( U.S.A.). Earliest dates of calling frogs recorded by Albert Hazen Wright between 1900 and 1912 near Ithaca were compared to those from the New York State Amphibian and Reptile Atlas Project for 1990–1999 for the three counties surrounding Ithaca. Four species are now calling 10–13 days earlier, two are unchanged, and none is calling later. The data suggest that climate has warmed in central New York State during this century and has resulted in earlier breeding in some amphibians—a possible first indication of biotic response to climate change in eastern North America.},

	abstract = {Recent research suggests that genetic diversity in plant populations can shape the diversity and abundance of consumer communities. We tested this hypothesis in a field experiment by manipulating patches of Evening Primrose (Oenothera biennis) to contain one, four or eight plant genotypes. We then surveyed 92 species of naturally colonizing arthropods. Genetically diverse plant patches had 18\% more arthropod species, and a greater abundance of omnivorous and predacious arthropods, but not herbivores, compared with monocultures. The effects of genotypic diversity on arthropod communities were due to a combination of interactive and additive effects among genotypes within genetically diverse patches. Greater genetic diversity also led to a selective feedback, as mean genotype fitness was 27\% higher in diverse patches than in monocultures. A comparison between our results and the literature reveals that genetic diversity and species diversity can have similar qualitative and quantitative effects on arthropod communities. Our findings also illustrate the benefit of preserving genetic variation to conserve species diversity and interactions within multitrophic communities.},

In no-choice field experiments with adult female psyllids in clip-on cages, we compared (1) leaf-settling, honeydew production, and survival of the Ctenarytaina species on juvenile and adult leaves of E. globulus, (2) leaf-settling and survival of G. brimblecombei on juvenile and adult leaves, (3) leaf-settling and survival of the three species on waxy (untreated) juvenile leaves and de-waxed (rubbed) juvenile leaves, and (4) leaf-settling and survival of C. spatulata on juvenile leaves from which wax was repeatedly removed. Leaf-settling by C. eucalypti was significantly greater on juvenile than adult leaves, however, honeydew production and survival were equal on both leaf types. In contrast, leaf-settling, honeydew production, and survival by C. spatulata were significantly greater on adult than juvenile leaves. Similarly, leaf-settling and survival by G. brimblecombei were significantly greater on adult than juvenile leaves. Wax removal from juvenile leaves significantly increased leaf-settling and survival of C. spatulata and G. brimblecombei. Although wax removal decreased leaf-settling by C. eucalypti, it did not affect survival. Repeated removal of regenerating wax from juvenile leaves did not affect leaf-settling or survival of C. spatulata.

It has been suggested that tree diversity decreases insect herbivory in forests, but recent studies have reported opposite patterns, indicating that tree diversity can trigger associational resistance or susceptibility. The mechanisms underlying the tree diversity–resistance relationship thus remain a matter of debate. * We assessed insect herbivory on pedunculate oak saplings (Quercus robur) in a large-scale experiment in which we manipulated tree diversity and identity by mixing oaks, birch and pine species. * Tree diversity at the plot scale had no effect on damage due to leaf chewers, but abundance of leaf miners decreased with increasing tree diversity. The magnitude of this associational resistance increased with host dilution, consistent with the ‘resource concentration hypothesis’. * At a smaller scale, we estimated tree apparency as the difference in total height between focal oak saplings and their nearest neighbouring trees. Levels of oak infestation with leaf miners decreased significantly with decreasing tree apparency. As the probability of having taller neighbours increased with tree diversity, notably due to the increase in the proportion of faster growing nonhost trees, such as birches and pines, tree apparency may be seen as a ‘hidden’, sampling effect of tree diversity. * Synthesis. These findings suggest that greater host dilution and lower tree apparency contribute to associational resistance in young trees. They also highlight the importance of taking plant size into account as a covariate, to avoid misleading interpretations about the biodiversity–resistance relationship.},

            BEAGLE is a high-performance likelihood-calculation library for phylogenetic inference. The BEAGLE library defines a simple, but flexible, application programming interface (API), and includes a collection of efficient implementations for calculation under a variety of evolutionary models on different hardware devices. The library has been integrated into recent versions of popular phylogenetics software packages including BEAST and MrBayes and has been widely used across a diverse range of evolutionary studies. Here, we present BEAGLE 3 with new parallel implementations, increased performance for challenging data sets, improved scalability, and better usability. We have added new OpenCL and central processing unit-threaded implementations to the library, allowing the effective utilization of a wider range of modern hardware. Further, we have extended the API and library to support concurrent computation of independent partial likelihood arrays, for increased performance of nucleotide-model analyses with greater flexibility of data partitioning. For better scalability and usability, we have improved how phylogenetic software packages use BEAGLE in multi-GPU (graphics processing unit) and cluster environments, and introduced an automated method to select the fastest device given the data set, evolutionary model, and hardware. For application developers who wish to integrate the library, we also have developed an online tutorial. To evaluate the effect of the improvements, we ran a variety of benchmarks on state-of-the-art hardware. For a partitioned exemplar analysis, we observe run-time performance improvements as high as 5.9-fold over our previous GPU implementation. BEAGLE 3 is free, open-source software licensed under the Lesser GPL and available at https://beagle-dev.github.io.},

The long-distance response of the beetles to tree odors may be a key feature of the mechanism of host recognition and selection. We used a laboratory olfactometer to study the walking response of 1,440 O. erosus to odor cues from the bark and phloem of six North American tree species. The beetle moved toward the angiosperm non-host Betula papyrifera more than would be expected by chance, but had a neutral response to odors of two tree species that support reproduction and three species that do not.

We experimentally tested for an eco-evolutionary feedback loop in the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, by manipulating initial densities and evolution. We found strong evidence that initial aphid density alters the rate and direction of evolution, as measured by changes in genotype frequencies through time. We also found that evolution of aphids within only 16 days, or approximately three generations, alters the rate of population growth and predicts density compared to nonevolving controls. The impact of evolution on population dynamics also depended on density. In one evolution treatment, evolution accelerated population growth by up to 10.3\% at high initial density or reduced it by up to 6.4\% at low initial density. The impact of evolution on population growth was as strong as or stronger than that caused by a threefold change in intraspecific density. We found that, taken together, ecological condition, here intraspecific density, alters evolutionary dynamics, which in turn alter concurrent population growth rate (ecological dynamics) in an eco-evolutionary feedback loop. Our results suggest that ignoring evolution in studies predicting population dynamics might lead us to over- or underestimate population density and that we cannot predict the evolutionary outcome within aphid populations without considering population size.},

To address these questions we planted full-sib families that had been selected for stress tolerance in a factorial design in which selection history was fully crossed with the current environment (eight families × six selection histories × six current environments × three blocks=864 plants). Our data suggest that leaf hair density is a complex character composed of two separable traits: leaf area and the number of hairs initiated per leaf. Leaf size is primarily controlled by the growth environment, whereas leaf hair initiation shows more genetically based variation. In the control and low water environments there was a negative linear relationship between leaf size and leaf hair density. However, within the low light and high boron treatments, leaf hair density remained constant across a range of leaf sizes, suggesting that these stresses disrupt normal leaf hair development. Selection gradient analysis showed that leaf hair density and leaf size were significantly positively associated with fitness in 4/6 of our environments. Our results suggest that environmental variation may diminish the ability of herbivores and pathogens to cause directional selection on leaf hair density.},

For example, adaptation to different ecological environments, via divergent selection, can result in the evolution of reproductive incompatibility between populations. Phytophagous insects have been at the forefront of these investigations of ‘ecological speciation’ and it is clear that adaptation to different host plants can promote insect speciation. However, much remains unknown. For example, there is abundant variability in the extent to which divergent selection promotes speciation, the sources of divergent selection, the types of reproductive barriers involved, and the genetic basis of divergent adaptation. We review these factors here. Several findings emerge, including the observation that although numerous different sources of divergent selection and reproductive isolation can be involved in insect speciation, their order of evolution and relative importance are poorly understood. Another finding is that the genetic basis of host preference and performance can involve loci of major effect and opposing dominance, factors which might facilitate speciation in the face of gene flow. In addition, we raise a number of other recent issues relating to phytophagous insect speciation, such as alternatives to ecological speciation, the geography of speciation, and the molecular signatures of speciation. Throughout, we aim to both synthesize what is known, as well as highlight areas where future work is especially needed.},

	abstract = {Datura wrightii is dimorphic for leaf trichome type in southern California. “Sticky” plants produce glandular trichomes that secrete acylsugars, whereas velvety plants produce nonglandular trichomes. Glandular trichomes confer resistance to some potential insect herbivores and are associated with reduced feeding in the field by two native coleopteran herbivores: the tobacco flea beetle, Epitrix hirtipennis, and a weevil, Trichobaris compacta. In contrast, another native beetle, Lema daturaphila, damages sticky and velvety plants similarly in the field. A series of choice and no-choice “ester removal” and “ester addition” feeding experiments were performed in the laboratory to evaluate the role of acylsugars in feeding by all three insect species. Consumption of sticky leaves after their esters were removed by washing was compared to consumption of unwashed sticky leaves and velvety leaves in ester removal experiments. Consumption of velvety leaves was measured after acylsugars were applied to those leaves in controlled amounts in the ester addition experiments. Consumption by E. hirtipennis was reduced by acylsugars in all experiments. Consumption by T. compacta was reduced by acylsugars in the ester removal experiments, but not in the ester addition experiments. The location of the acylsugars at the tip of a long trichome, rather than simply on the leaf surface, may be an important component of the biological activity of acylsugars against T. compacta in nature. Consumption by L. daturaphila was not significantly reduced by acylsugars in any experiment. The acylsugars caused no significant mortality of any of the three insect species.},

Current predictions for long-term symbiont prevalence are based on their fitness benefits and vertical transmission rates but ignore nonlinear competitive feedbacks among symbiotic and symbiont-free hosts. We hypothesized that such feedbacks function as stabilizing mechanisms, promoting coexistence of host types and maintaining intermediate symbiont frequency at the population scale. Using a model grass/endophyte symbiosis, we manipulated competition within and between endophyte-symbiotic (E+) and endophyte-free (E−) hosts and fit competition models to experimental data. We show for the first time that symbiont-structured competition can generate stable coexistence of E+ and E− hosts, even under perfect vertical transmission. Niche differentiation was the key to coexistence, causing hosts of each type to limit themselves more strongly than each other. These results establish roles for nonlinear competitive dynamics and niche differentiation in the ecology and evolution of heritable symbionts.},

Here we investigated the role of vegetative herbivory, a ubiquitous biotic factor limiting plant reproduction, in the mating system expression of Impatiens capensis (Balsaminaceae), a species with an obligate mixed-mating system (individuals produce both selfing, cleistogamous, and facultatively outcrossing, chasmogamous flowers). Herbivory reduced proportional chasmogamous reproduction partially, but not entirely, through a reduction in plant size and the strength of this effect varied among replicates. Herbivory decreased geitonogamous selfing in chasmogamous flowers via several mechanisms including reduced chasmogamous flower display size and pollinator visitation rate and altered pollinator composition. Overall, herbivory caused a decrease in whole-plant outcrossing, indicating that the effects of herbivory on proportional chasmogamous reproduction, which favor selfing, outweigh the effects on chasmogamous outcrossing rate, which favor outcrossing. Not only do our findings unravel the mechanisms underlying herbivore-mediated changes in the mating system, but they also point to the role of natural enemies in contributing to the maintenance of a mixed mating system.},

However, improving our understanding of the causes of mating system evolution requires ecological and genetic studies of the early stages of mating system transition. Here, we examine nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequences and microsatellite variation in a large sample of populations of Arabidopsis lyrata from the Great Lakes region of Eastern North American that show intra- and interpopulation variation in the degree of self-incompatibility and realized outcrossing rates. Populations show strong geographic clustering irrespective of mating system, suggesting that selfing either evolved multiple times or has spread to multiple genetic backgrounds. Diversity is reduced in selfing populations, but not to the extent of the severe loss of variation expected if selfing evolved due to selection for reproductive assurance in connection with strong founder events. The spread of self-compatibility in this region may have been favored as colonization bottlenecks following glaciation or migration from Europe reduced standing levels of inbreeding depression. However, our results do not suggest a single transition to selfing in this system, as has been suggested for some other species in the Brassicaceae.},

	abstract = {The comparison between neutral genetic differentiation (FST) and quantitative genetic differentiation (QST) is commonly used to test for signatures of selection in population divergence. However, there is an ongoing discussion about what FST actually measures, even resulting in some alternative metrics to express neutral genetic differentiation. If there is a problem with FST, this could have repercussions for its comparison with QST as well. We show that as the mutation rate of the neutral marker increases, FST decreases: a higher within-population heterozygosity (He) yields a lower FST value. However, the same is true for QST: a higher mutation rate for the underlying QTL also results in a lower QST estimate. The effect of mutation rate is equivalent in QST and FST. Hence, the comparison between QST and FST remains valid, if one uses neutral markers whose mutation rates are not too high compared to those of quantitative traits. Usage of highly variable neutral markers such as hypervariable microsatellites can lead to serious biases and the incorrect inference that divergent selection has acted on populations. Much of the discussion on FST seems to stem from the misunderstanding that it measures the differentiation of populations, whereas it actually measures the fixation of alleles. In their capacity as measures of population differentiation, Hedrick’s G′ST and Jost’s D reach their maximum value of 1 when populations do not share alleles even when there remains variation within populations, which invalidates them for comparisons with QST.},

	abstract = {The ‘most effective pollinator principle’ implies that floral characteristics often reflect adaptation to the pollinator that transfers the most pollen, through a combination of high rate of visitation to flowers and effective deposition of pollen during each visit. We looked for the expected positive correlation between quantity and quality of visits in Ipomopsis aggregata, whose red, tubular flowers are considered to be adapted to hummingbirds. Hummingbirds were indeed the most common floral visitors in 5 years of observation. However, long-tongued bumblebees deposited on average three-times as much outcross pollen per visit to virgin flowers, and elicited four-times as much seed production, as did hummingbirds. Hence visitors that are relatively infrequent, and unexpected given the ‘pollination syndrome’ of the plant, can be surprisingly good pollinators. One interpretation of this observation is that natural selection favours a specialized floral morphology that excludes all but a single type of visitor, but that there are constraints on achieving this outcome. An alternative is that selection favours some degree of floral generalization, but that flowers can retain features that adapt them to a particular type of pollinator in spite of this generalization.

Current models of metacommunity dynamics differ chiefly in the relative emphasis placed on dispersal limitation and niche differentiation as causal mechanisms structuring ecological communities. Herein we investigate the relative roles of these two mechanisms in structuring primate communities in Africa, South America, Madagascar and Borneo.2. We hypothesized that if dispersal limitation is important in structuring communities, then community similarity should depend on geographical proximity even after controlling for ecological similarity. Conversely, if communities are assembled primarily through niche processes, then community similarity should be determined by ecological similarity regardless of geographical proximity.3. We performed Mantel and partial Mantel tests to investigate correlations among primate community similarity, ecological distance and geographical distance. Results showed significant and strongly negative relationships between diurnal primate community similarity and both ecological similarity and geographical distance in Madagascar, but significant and stronger negative relationships between community similarity and geographical distance in African, South American and Bornean metacommunities.4. We conclude that dispersal limitation is an important determinant of primate community structure and may play a stronger role in shaping the structure of some terrestrial vertebrate communities than niche differentiation. These patterns are consistent with neutral theory. We recommend tests of functional equivalence to determine the extent to which neutral theory may explain primate community composition.},

	abstract = {1 According to the Prentice-Sugita model, pollen loading (PL) is linearly related to the distance-weighted plant abundance (DWPA) surrounding a sedimentary basin. Since source trees of pollen far away from a basin have much less influence on pollen representation than source trees near a basin, the correlation between PL and DWPA should approach an asymptote as the vegetation sampling area increases. The `relevant source area' for pollen can be defined as the area beyond which the correlation does not improve. 2 A simulation experiment using patchy vegetation landscapes illustrates this principle, demonstrating that \$rˆ2\$ and likelihood function scores do not improve when vegetation sampling increases beyond certain distances. This suggests that very little additional information on the pollen-plant abundance relationship will be gained by a vegetation survey beyond the `relevant' distance when data are collected from regions of similar vegetation type and spatial pattern. 3 The `relevant' source area for pollen in lakes in the simulated landscapes is within 50-100 m from the lake edge for forest hollows (radius of hollow \$R = 2 m\$), 300-400 m for small lakes (\$R = 50 m\$), and 600-800 m for medium size lakes \$(R = 250 m\$). Although only about 30-45\% of total pollen loading comes from within these distances, the model demonstrates that when the background pollen is consistent, this proportion is adequate to reflect local vegetation composition. 4 The simulation results show that pollen data from large lakes (\$R = 750 m\$) show little site-to-site variation, especially for a species that grows in small patches (radii of 80 m in the simulated landscape). Linear regression and maximum likelihood methods therefore do not provide accurate estimations of pollen productivity and background pollen loading. Vegetation may appear homogeneous even when the actual pattern of vegetation is heterogeneous and patchy, depending on the size of lake relative to the size of patches. 5 The pollen-plant abundance data should be collected from regions with similar forest composition to determine the `relevant' source area and the parameters of a linear relationship between PL and DWPA. Otherwise, either the linear regression or maximum likelihood methods provide inaccurate estimates of the relevant source area and parameters even when the simulation data with no sampling and counting errors are used.},

This information can be useful for our fundamental understanding of population differentiation, as well as for identifying management units in conservation biology. Here, we provide comprehensive review and meta-analysis of the empirical studies that have compared quantitative genetic (QST) and neutral marker (FST) differentiation among natural populations. Our analyses confirm the conclusion from previous reviews – based on ca. 100\% more data – that the QST values are on average higher than FST values [mean difference 0.12 (SD 0.27)] suggesting a predominant role for natural selection as a cause of differentiation in quantitative traits. However, although the influence of trait (life history, morphological and behavioural) and marker type (e.g. microsatellites and allozymes) on the variance of the difference between QST and FST is small, there is much heterogeneity in the data attributable to variation between specific studies and traits. The latter is understandable as there is no reason to expect that natural selection would be acting in similar fashion on all populations and traits (except for fitness itself). We also found evidence to suggest that QST and FST values across studies are positively correlated, but the significance of this finding remains unclear. We discuss these results in the context of utility of the QST–FST comparisons as a tool for inferring natural selection, as well as associated methodological and interpretational problems involved with individual and meta-analytic studies.},

	abstract = {Estimates of inbreeding depression obtained from the literature were used to evaluate the association between inbreeding depression and the degree of self-fertilization in natural plant populations. Theoretical models predict that the magnitude of inbreeding depression will decrease with inbreeding as deleterious recessive alleles are expressed and purged through selection. If selection acts differentially among life history stages and deleterious effects are uncorrelated among stages, then the timing of inbreeding depression may also evolve with inbreeding. Estimates of cumulative inbreeding depression and stage-specific inbreeding depression (four stages: seed production of parent, germination, juvenile survival, and growth/reproduction) were compiled for 79 populations (using means of replicates, N = 62) comprising 54 species from 23 families of vascular plants. Where available, data on the mating system also were collected and used as a measure of inbreeding history A significant negative correlation was found between cumulative inbreeding depression and the primary selfing rate for the combined sample of angiosperms (N = 35) and gymnosperms (N = 9); the correlation was significant for angiosperms but not gymnosperms examined separately The average inbreeding depression in predominantly selfing species (δ = 0.23) was significantly less (43\%) than that in predominantly outcrossing species (δ = 0.53). These results support the theoretical prediction that selfing reduces the magnitude of inbreeding depression. Most self-fertilizing species expressed the majority of their inbreeding depression late in the life cycle, at the stage of growth/reproduction (14 of 18 species), whereas outcrossing species expressed much of their inbreeding depression either early, at seed production (17 of 40 species), or late (19 species). For species with four life stages examined, selfing and outcrossing species differed in the magnitude of inbreeding depression at the stage of seed production (selfing δ = 0.05, N = 11, outcrossing δ = 0.32, N = 31), germination (selfing δ = 0.02, outcrossing δ = 0.12), and survival to reproduction (selfing δ = 0.04, outcrossing δ = 0.15), but not at growth and reproduction (selfing δ = 0.21, outcrossing δ = 0.27); inbreeding depression in selfers relative to outcrossers increased from early to late life stages. These results support the hypothesis that most early acting inbreeding depression is due to recessive lethals and can be purged through inbreeding, whereas much of the late-acting inbreeding depression is due to weakly deleterious mutations and is very difficult to purge, even under extreme inbreeding.},

Because local adaptation results from the interaction between natural selection and adaptive traits, it is crucial to investigate both to understand ecological speciation. Previously, we used niche modelling to identify local water availability as an environmental correlate of incipient ecological speciation between two subspecies in Boechera stricta, a close relative of Arabidopsis. Here, we performed several large-scale glasshouse experiments to investigate the divergence of various physiological, phenological and morphological traits. Although we found no significant difference in physiological traits, the Western subspecies has significantly faster growth rate, larger leaf area, less succulent leaves, delayed reproductive time and longer flowering duration. These trait differences are concordant with previous results that habitats of the Western genotypes have more consistent water availability, while Eastern genotypes inhabit locations with more ephemeral water supplies. In addition, by comparing univariate and multivariate divergence of complex traits (QST) to the genomewide distribution of SNP FST, we conclude that the aspects of phenology and morphology (but not physiology) are under divergent selection. In addition, we also identified several highly diverged traits without obvious water-related functions.},

	abstract = {Levels of genetic differentiation between populations can be highly variable across the genome, with divergent selection contributing to such heterogeneous genomic divergence. For example, loci under divergent selection and those tightly physically linked to them may exhibit stronger differentiation than neutral regions with weak or no linkage to such loci. Divergent selection can also increase genome-wide neutral differentiation by reducing gene flow (e.g. by causing ecological speciation), thus promoting divergence via the stochastic effects of genetic drift. These consequences of divergent selection are being reported in recently accumulating studies that identify: (i) ‘outlier loci’ with higher levels of divergence than expected under neutrality, and (ii) a positive association between the degree of adaptive phenotypic divergence and levels of molecular genetic differentiation across population pairs [‘isolation by adaptation’ (IBA)]. The latter pattern arises because as adaptive divergence increases, gene flow is reduced (thereby promoting drift) and genetic hitchhiking increased. Here, we review and integrate these previously disconnected concepts and literatures. We find that studies generally report 5–10\% of loci to be outliers. These selected regions were often dispersed across the genome, commonly exhibited replicated divergence across different population pairs, and could sometimes be associated with specific ecological variables. IBA was not infrequently observed, even at neutral loci putatively unlinked to those under divergent selection. Overall, we conclude that divergent selection makes diverse contributions to heterogeneous genomic divergence. Nonetheless, the number, size, and distribution of genomic regions affected by selection varied substantially among studies, leading us to discuss the potential role of divergent selection in the growth of regions of differentiation (i.e. genomic islands of divergence), a topic in need of future investigation.},

The perennial herb Arabidopsis lyrata (Brassicaceae) is polymorphic for trichome production and occurs in a glabrous and trichome-producing form.

To examine the genetic basis of glabrousness, we conducted controlled crosses with plants originating from two natural populations in Sweden (one polymorphic for trichome-production, and one consisting of glabrous plants only). In addition, we estimated the heritability of trichome number from parent-offspring regressions for plants originating from the polymorphic population. Crosses between glabrous plants resulted in glabrous offspring only, whereas crosses between glabrous and trichome-producing plants, and crosses between trichome-producing individuals, resulted in either all trichome-producing offspring or both phenotypes. In segregating crosses between trichome-producing plants, the ratio of glabrous:trichome-producing offspring did not deviate significantly from 1:3, while in segregating crosses between glabrous and trichome-producing individuals the ratio did in most cases not deviate from 1:1. Within- and between-population crosses gave similar results. The heritability of trichome number estimated from regression of offspring on mid-parent was high (h2±SE, 0.65±0.15). The results suggest that glabrousness is inherited in a simple Mendelian fashion, with the allele coding for trichome production being dominant over that for glabrousness. They further indicate that glabrousness is due to a mutation at the same locus in both populations.},

Specific glucosinolates can act as feeding deterrents or stimulants, depending upon the insect species. Hence, natural selection might favor the presence of diverse glucosinolate profiles within a given species. We determined quantitative and qualitative variation in glucosinolates in the leaves and seeds of 39 Arabidopsis ecotypes. We identified 34 different glucosinolates, of which the majority are chain-elongated compounds derived from methionine. Polymorphism at only five loci was sufficient to generate 14 qualitatitvely different leaf glucosinolate profiles. Thus, there appears to be a modular genetic system regulating glucosinolate profiles in Arabidopsis. This system allows the rapid generation of new glucosinolate combinations in response to changing herbivory or other selective pressures. In addition to the qualitative variation in glucosinolate profiles, we found a nearly 20-fold difference in the quantity of total aliphatic glucosinolates and were able to identify a single locus that controls nearly three-quarters of this variation.},

We reviewed the literature on aphids and their parasitoids to explore the various possible indirect interactions that can occur in such communities. The review was motivated by our study of a particular aphid–parasitoid community in a natural (i.e., nonagricultural) habitat, and by the wealth of information that exists about aphid–parasitoid systems in agricultural settings. We focused our review on aphid–parasitoid interactions, but considered how these were influenced by the other aphid natural enemies and also by aphid mutualists and host plants. We conclude that indirect effects are likely to have a major effect in structuring aphid–parasitoid communities, and that the latter are a valuable model system for testing ideas about community interactions.},

A body of theory has developed that predicts how different species traits, such as rates of gene flow and generation times, influence local adaptation in coevolutionary species interactions. We used a meta‐analysis of local‐adaptation studies across a broad range of host‐parasite interactions to evaluate predictions about the effect of species traits on local adaptation. We also evaluated how experimental design influences the outcome of local adaptation experiments. In reciprocally designed experiments, the relative gene flow rate of hosts versus parasites was the strongest predictor of local adaptation, with significant parasite local adaptation only in the studies in which parasites had greater gene flow rates than their hosts. When nonreciprocal studies were included in analyses, species traits did not explain significant variation in local adaptation, although the overall level of local adaptation observed was lower in the nonreciprocal than in the reciprocal studies. This formal meta‐analysis across a diversity of host‐parasite systems lends insight into the role of both biology (species traits) and biologists (experimental design) in detecting local adaptation in coevolving species interactions.},

This study uses a spatially explicit cellular automaton model to explore how the scale of dispersal interacts with the scale and strength of negative frequency dependence to determine patterns of species distribution. Counter to expectation, strong local frequency-dependent interactions result in random spatial patterns. When dispersal scale and interaction scale are decoupled, the resulting patterns are not necessarily random. For strong negative frequency dependence, stable bands result when the scale of interaction exceeds the scale of dispersal, and bands with two-point cycles result when the scale of dispersal exceeds the scale of interaction. However, for weaker interactions occurring over intermediate scales, only random patterns result. Thus, our results call into question the utility of inferring any ecological interaction from only the spatial distributions of the putatively interacting species. Furthermore, our results call for new experimental studies that explicitly manipulate the strength and the scale of the processes being studied.},

The community associated with Brassica oleracea L. (Cruciferae) was studied on plants grown in single-species planting and on plants grown in the mixed vegetation of a 15-year fallow field. Approximately 300 species of plants and 3,000 species of heterotrophs existed in the fallow field and these provided species diversity. In 1957, 27 taxa were associated with B. oleracea grown in mixed-species planting and 50 taxa were associated with it in the single-species planting. Three to four times as many parasitic and predaceous taxa were present in the single-species planting. Aphid, flea beetle, and lepidopteran populations reached outbreak levels in the single-species planting, but no such outbreaks occurred in the mixed-species planting. These trends were substantiated in 1958. Thus, it was concluded that species diversity play an important role in preventing population outbreaks. Where possible in cultivation, faunal and floral varieties should be encouraged. The use of specific pesticides and biological control agents to remove pests without sterilization should prove a sound practice.},

	abstract = {Summary The spatial arrangement of suitable host plants in the field may significantly constrain insects to find optimal hosts. Plant neighbours around a focal host plant can either lead to lower (associational resistance) or higher (associational susceptibility) herbivore loads. We tested whether the spatial arrangement of hosts of different suitability for the larval development of the shoot-base boring weevil Apion onopordi affects oviposition decisions in the field. Host plants in our study were healthy creeping thistles (Cirsium arvense; suboptimal hosts) and thistles infected by a rust pathogen (Puccinia punctiformis; optimal hosts). For analysis, we used nearest neighbour methods that disentangle the spatial distribution of organisms that are dependent on the position of other species (e.g. phytophagous insects and their host plants). Although theory predicts that the small-scale spatial infestation pattern can have major consequences for the population dynamics in insect–plant systems, field studies quantifying spatial pattern of phytophagous insects are rare. The spatial arrangement of host plants clearly influenced oviposition pattern in A. onopordi. In contrast to previous studies, we demonstrated that not the rust infection itself determined if a plant was infested by weevils, but rather the density of rusted shoots within a certain neighbourhood. We found strong indications for associational susceptibility of healthy thistle shoots to weevil oviposition when growing in the neighbourhood of rusted thistles. Weevil-infested plants were spatially aggregated, indicating that A. onopordi is limited in its dispersal ability within patches. Other stem-boring insects on creeping thistle were affected in their oviposition decisions by other factors than A. onopordi. Thus, it may be difficult to find general rules for oviposition choice in phytophagous insects. Our study showed that the spatial arrangement of host plants in the field critically determines oviposition choice and should thus be included as constraint in theories of optimal host selection.},

We suggest that this distribution results from selection for the maintenance of outcrossing in historically large, outcrossing populations with substantial inbreeding depression, and from selection for selfing when increased inbreeding, due to pollinator failure or population bottlenecks, reduces the level of inbreeding depression. Few species or populations are fixed at complete selfing or complete outcrossing. A low level of selfing in primarily outcrossing species is unlikely to be selectively advantageous, but will not reduce inbreeding depression to the level where selfing is selectively favored, particularly if accompanied by reproductive compensation. Similarly, occasional outcrossing in primarily selfing species is unlikely to regularly provide sufficient heterosis to maintain selection for outcrossing through individual selection. Genetic, morphological and ecological constraints may limit the potential for outcrossing rates in selfers to be reduced below some minimum level.},

	abstract = {Traditional approaches to the question of the effects of plant secondary metabolites on the feeding choices of folivores of Eucalyptus have focused on the tree species level, although numerous field studies of foraging behaviour have identified selection at the level of the individual trees. Attempts to relate these decisions to deterrency resulting from secondary leaf chemistry have been inconclusive because assays used have focused on broad groups of compounds such as “total” phenolics. In this study we have conducted no-choice feeding trials with two arboreal mammalian folivores, the common ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus) and the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), to measure deterrency of individual trees of two species of Eucalyptus, E. ovata and E. viminalis. Average daily intakes of E. ovata foliage by common ringtail possums ranged from 2.5 to 50 g kg−0.75 body mass. Koala intakes of foliage from the same individual trees ranged from 22.4 to 36.3 g kg−0.75 body mass. When fed foliage from different individual E. viminalis trees, common ringtail possums ate between 1.26 and 6.28 g kg−0.75 body mass while koalas ate from 14.3 to 45.9 g kg−0.75 body mass. Correlative analyses showed no relationships between feeding and several measures of nutritional quality, nor with total phenolics or condensed tannins. They did, however, identify two groups of plant secondary metabolites that may cause deterrency: terpenes, and a defined group of phenolic compounds, the diformylphloroglucinols (DFPs). Further bioassay experiments with common ringtail possums showed that only the DFPs could cause the effects seen with the foliage experiments at concentrations similar to those found in the leaves. We argue that, when in sufficiently high concentrations, DFPs determine the level of food intake by these animals irrespective of other questions of nutritional quality of the leaves.},

Recent studies have identified the genetic basis of distinct phenotypes, but it is poorly understood how the variation in candidate loci is maintained in natural environments. In this study, we examined fitness consequences and genetic basis of variation in trichome production in a natural population of Arabidopsis halleri subsp. gemmifera. Half of the individuals in the study population produced trichomes while the other half were glabrous, and the leaf beetle Phaedon brassicae imposed intensive damage to both phenotypes. The fitness of hairy and glabrous plants showed no significant differences in the field during two years. A similar result was obtained when sibling hairy and glabrous plants were transplanted at the same field site, whereas a fitness cost of trichome production was detected under a weak herbivory condition. Thus, equivalent fitness of hairy and glabrous plants under natural herbivory allows their coexistence in the contemporary population. The pattern of polymorphism of the candidate trichome gene GLABROUS1 (GL1) showed no evidence of long-term maintenance of trichome variation within the population. Although balancing selection under fluctuating biotic environments is often proposed to explain the maintenance of defense variation, the lack of clear evidence of balancing selection in the study population suggests that other factors such as gene flow and neutral process may have played relatively large roles in shaping trichome variation at least for the single population level.},

	abstract = {Studying the genetic basis of traits involved in ecological interactions is a fundamental part of elucidating the connections between evolutionary and ecological processes. Such knowledge allows one to link genetic models of trait evolution with ecological models describing interactions within and between species. Previous work has shown that connections between genetic and ecological processes in Arabidopsis thaliana may be mediated by the fact that quantitative trait loci (QTL) with ‘direct’ effects on traits of individuals also have pleiotropic ‘indirect’ effects on traits expressed in neighbouring plants. Here, we further explore these connections by examining functional relationships between traits affected directly and indirectly by the same QTL. We develop a novel approach using structural equation models (SEMs) to determine whether observed pleiotropic effects result from traits directly affected by the QTL in focal individuals causing the changes in the neighbours' phenotypes. This hypothesis was assessed using SEMs to test whether focal plant phenotypes appear to mediate the connection between the focal plants' genotypes and the phenotypes of their neighbours, or alternatively, whether the connection between the focal plants' genotypes and the neighbours' phenotypes is mediated by unmeasured traits. We implement this analysis using a QTL of major effect that maps to the well-characterized flowering locus, FRIGIDA. The SEMs support the hypothesis that the pleiotropic indirect effects of this locus arise from size and developmental timing-related traits in focal plants affecting the expression of developmental traits in their neighbours. Our findings provide empirical insights into the genetics and nature of intraspecific ecological interactions. Our technique holds promise in directing future work into the genetic basis and functional relationship of traits mediating and responding to ecological interactions.},

	abstract = {* 1To determine the mechanisms by which metal hyperaccumulation in plants could provide a chemical defence against insect herbivores, the feeding behaviour and performance of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria (Forskål), was investigated on plants of Thlaspi caerulescens J. \& C. Presl containing different zinc concentrations, as well as on artificial food differing only in Zn content. * 2In choice experiments, locusts preferred T. caerulescens plants containing low foliar Zn concentrations (mean value 0·42 mg g−1 dry biomass) compared with intermediate (1·50 mg g−1) or high (5·77 mg g−1) Zn concentrations. In no-choice experiments, there was no difference in the duration of the first meal, suggesting that locusts could not taste Zn directly, but total time spent feeding, amount of foliage eaten, and locust growth rate all decreased as foliar Zn concentration increased. * 3When presented with artificial food containing Zn concentrations of 0·5, 1·5 or 5·5 mg g−1, locusts fed at a slower rate on intermediate- and high-Zn diets, and their development time from fourth to fifth stadium was proportionately longer. The total amount of food eaten over the fourth stadium was similar for the different treatments, but locust mass gain was inversely related to Zn concentration in the diet. This was reflected in lower nutrient-utilization efficiencies in locusts on a high-Zn diet. * 4In choice experiments with artificial food, locusts showed very similar feeding behaviour to that on plants, consuming more of the low-Zn food. Experiments using food flavoured with coumarin, provided with or without Zn, showed that the locusts’ aversion to Zn develops by a post-ingestive feedback mechanism involving associative learning. * 5These results support the notion that metal hyperaccumulation in plants can provide a defence against insect herbivores, and demonstrate that metal concentration per se can account for the deterrent effect of high-Zn foods. Aversion responses were evoked by Zn concentrations in the range 0·5–5 mg g−1, an order of magnitude lower than those commonly observed in the foliage of T. caerulescens. This suggests that comparatively small elevations in Zn concentration could confer an adaptive advantage on plants by influencing the feeding behaviour of polyphagous insect herbivores, thereby contributing to evolution of the metal-hyperaccumulation trait.},

Here, we gauge the impact of meta-analyses in ecology quantitatively and qualitatively. For the quantitative assessment, we conducted an analysis of 240 published meta-analyses to examine trends in ecological meta-analyses. Our examination shows that publication rates of meta-analyses in ecology have increased through time, and that more recent meta-analyses have been more comprehensive, including more studies and a greater temporal range of studies. Meta-analyses in ecology are the result of larger collaborations with meta-analyses being authored by larger teams than other studies, and those funded by collaborative centers have even larger collaborations. These larger collaborations result in a larger scope and scale of the analyses—by using more papers, datasets, species and years of data. Qualitatively, we discuss three examples: the strength of competition, the nature of how biodiversity affects ecosystem function, and the response of species to global climate change, where meta-analyses supplied the critical evaluation of accepted ecological explanations. As scientific criticism and controversy mount, the true power of meta-analyses is to serve as the capstone evidence supporting the validity of an explanation and to possibly herald the shift to other potential explanations.},

This variation is significantly positively correlated with frog coloration brightness, a viewer-independent measure of visual conspicuousness (i.e., total reflectance flux). We also examine conspicuousness from the view of three potential predator taxa, as well as conspecific frogs, using taxon-specific visual detection models and three natural background substrates. We find very strong positive relationships between frog toxicity and conspicuousness for bird-specific perceptual models. Weaker but still positive correlations are found for crab and D. pumilio conspecific visual perception, while frog coloration as viewed by snakes is not related to toxicity. These results suggest that poison frog colors can be honest signals of prey unpalatability to predators and that birds in particular may exert selection on aposematic signal design.},

	abstract = {The accuracies and efficiencies of three different methods of making phylogenetic trees from gene frequency data were examined by using computer simulation. The methods examined are UPGMA, Farris' (1972) method, and Tateno et al.'s (1982) modified Farris method. In the computer simulation eight species (or populations) were assumed to evolve according to a given model tree, and the evolutionary changes of allele frequencies were followed by using the infinite-allele model. At the end of the simulated evolution five genetic distance measures (Nei's standard and minimum distances, Rogers' distance, Cavalli-Sforza's fλ, and the modified Cavalli-Sforza distance) were computed for all pairs of species, and the distance matrix obtained for each distance measure was used for reconstructing a phylogenetic tree. The phylogenetic tree obtained was then compared with the model tree. The results obtained indicate that in all tree-making methods examined the accuracies of both the topology and branch lengths of a reconstructed tree (rooted tree) are very low when the number of loci used is less than 20 but gradually increase with increasing number of loci. When the expected number of gene substitutions (M) for the shortest branch is 0.1 or more per locus and 30 or more loci are used, the topological error as measured by the distortion index (dT) is not great, but the probability of obtaining the correct topology (P) is less than 0.5 even with 60 loci. When M is as small as 0.004, P is substantially lower. In obtaining a good topology (small dT and high P) UPGMA and the modified Farris method generally show a better performance than the Farris method. The poor performance of the Farris method is observed even when Rogers' distance which obeys the triangle inequality is used. The main reason for this seems to be that the Farris method often gives overestimates of branch lengths. For estimating the expected branch lengths of the true tree UPGMA shows the best performance. For this purpose Nei's standard distance gives a better result than the others because of its linear relationship with the number of gene substitutions. Rogers' or Cavalli-Sforza's distance gives a phylogenetic tree in which the parts near the root are condensed and the other parts are elongated. It is recommended that more than 30 loci, including both polymorphic and monomorphic loci, be used for making phylogentic trees. The conclusions from this study seem to apply also to data on nucleotide differences obtained by the restriction enzyme techniques.},

However, the traits underlying resistance and tolerance remain largely unknown, as does the genetic architecture of herbivory responses and the prevalence of genetic trade-offs. To address these issues, we measured resistance and tolerance to natural apical meristem damage (AMD) by rabbits in a large field experiment with recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of Arabidopsis thaliana (developed from a cross between the Columbia × Landsberg erecta ecotypes). We also measured phenological and morphological traits hypothesized to underlie resistance and tolerance to AMD. Recombinant inbred lines differed significantly in resistance (the proportion of replicates within an RIL that resisted herbivory), and early flowering plants with tall apical inflorescences were more likely to experience damage. Tolerance (the difference in fitness between the damaged and undamaged states), also differed significantly among RILs, with some lines overcompensating for damage and producing more fruit in the damaged than undamaged state. Plastic increases in basal branch number, basal branch height, and senescence date in response to damage were all associated with greater tolerance. There was no evidence for a genetic trade-off between resistance and tolerance, an observation consistent with the underlying differences in associated morphological and phenological characters. Selection gradient analysis detected no evidence for direct selection on either resistance or tolerance in this experiment. However, a statistical model indicates that the pattern of selection on resistance depends strongly on the mean level of tolerance, and selection on tolerance depends strongly on the mean level of resistance. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that selection may act to maintain resistance and tolerance at intermediate levels in spatially or temporally varying environments or those with varying herbivore populations.},

	abstract = {The population dynamics of six beetle pests (Chrysomelidae: Galerucinae) were studied for three seasons in monocultures and polycultures of the corn-bean-squash agroecosystem in Costa Rica. The study was designed to determine if beetle abundance differed among these treatments, and if so, to determine whether the differences were caused primarily by predators and parasites (Enemies Hypothesis) or by movement patterns of adult beetles (Resource Concentration Hypothesis). In polycultures containing at least one nonhost plant, the numbers of beetles per unit host plant (squash or bean) were significantly lower relative to the numbers of beetles on host plants in monocultures. This pattern was generally observed for each of the beetle species studied between 40 and 60 d after planting and continued until the end of the season. When a given beetle species fed on both crop species in a diculture (i.e., the squash-bean diculture), the general polyculture effect was reversed: beetle numbers were significantly greater on one or both of the host plants in the diculture relative to the respective monocultures. These effects were apparently caused by changes in species richness of the plots per se rather than changes in host density or total plant density in the plot. There were no differences in rates of parasitism or predation of beetles between monocultures and polycultures. Neither were there significant differences in beetle emergence between treatments that could account for differences in adult beetle numbers between monocultures and polycultures. Instead, several lines of evidence show that different movement patterns of adult beetles were primarily responsible for the observed pattern of beetle abundance and distribution. Direct measurements of beetle movements in the field showed that beetles tended to emigrate more from polycultures that included a nonhost plant than from host monocultures. Field observations and experiments showed that this was due to several factors: (1) beetles avoided host plants shaded by corn; (2) cornstalks interfered in some way with flight movements of beetles; (3) as beetles moved through polycultures they remained on nonhost plants significantly less time than on host plants and their overall rate of movement in polycultures was higher. These data suggest that the Resource Concentration Hypothesis rather than the Enemies Hypothesis can account for differences in beetle abundance between monocultures and polycultures. The implication of this finding for predicting herbivore abundance in yet untried agreocosystems are discussed. It is suggested that it is not sufficient merely to recognize that herbivores are less common in particular polycultures. Practical issues of agroecosystem design and more theoretical questions of plant-herbivore coevolution depend on knowing exactly what ecological processes create reduced herbivore loads in polycultures.},

A plant might be less colonized and experience associational resistance when it grows near repellent neighbors. In contrast, it might be more colonized and experience associational susceptibility near attractive neighbors. To date, mechanisms that drive associational defense are not really understood. In order to gain insights into the occurrence of associational resistance versus associational susceptibility under field conditions, we conducted an experiment to determine the influence of neighboring plants on the colonization of a focal plant by aphids. The focal plant was always Brassica oleracea. The neighbors were B. oleracea (control), B. napus, B. nigra, or Solanum lycopersicum, which represent contrasting levels of physical and chemical defenses. The focal plant, B. oleracea, was more colonized by the specialist aphid Brevicoryne brassicae, and experienced associational susceptibility when it was surrounded by B. nigra or B. napus. In contrast, B. oleracea was less colonized by the generalist aphid Myzus persicae, and experienced associational resistance when it was surrounded by S. lycopersicum, B. nigra or B. napus. Neighboring plants had no significant impact on host plant choice by the generalist aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae. In conclusion, attraction or repulsion of the specialist aphid B. brassicae and the generalist aphid M. persicae by B. nigra, B. napus, and S. lycopersicum resulted in associational susceptibility or associational resistance for B. oleracea.},

	abstract = {Watercress (Nasturtium officinale) is a spring-stream macrophyte that possesses glucosinolates, which are hydrolyzed to feeding deterrent isothiocyanates when the enzyme myrosinase is released by tissue damage. Previous studies indicated that frequently associated aquatic shredders strongly prefer yellowed-senescent leaves over fresh-green foliage, because the latter releases much more isothiocyanate than senescent watercress. When the action of myrosinase was blocked by heating the tissue, the shredders' preference shifted to heated-green tissue, which contains much more nitrogen than that found in senescent tissue. Here we report a series of no-choice experiments on various tissue types designed to determine intermediate and long-term consumption rates and associated impacts on growth and survival of shredders associated with watercress. The amphipod Gammarus pseudolimnaeus, the caddisflies Pycnopsyche sp., Hesperophylax designatus, and Limnephilus sp., and the snail Physella gyrina, all consumed much more senescent than fresh-green tissue. In long-term tests with G. pseudolimnaeus, H. designatus, and Limnephilus sp., growth was negative or zero on the defended fresh-green tissue and often highest on heated-green tissue. Reaction to glucosinolates differed among shredders. For the caddisflies, growth and survival were positively correlated with bulk tissue and nitrogen consumption, which were highest for heated-green tissue. However, amphipod survival was significantly lowered on heated-green watercress, although it was readily consumed. Therefore, consumption of high-glucosinolate tissue was detrimental to the amphipods but not to caddisflies. Our results indicate that the glucosinolate-myrosinase system defends live green watercress against herbivory by an array of aquatic invertebrates. These generalist herbivores forgo eating high-quality fresh-green leaves because of plant defenses and instead settle for lower quality senescent leaves. When the defense system was experimentally shut down, these herbivores readily consumed young green tissue and frequently showed higher growth rates than those achieved on the senescent, but undefended, leaves they typically consume. Evidently, these shredders face a trade-off of high nitrogen and high defense vs. low nitrogen and low defense.},

	abstract = {Abstract.— Motivated by data demonstrating fluctuating relative and absolute fitnesses for white- versus blue-flowered morphs of the desert annual Linanthus parryae, we present conditions under which temporally fluctuating selection and fluctuating contributions to a persistent seed bank will maintain a stable single-locus polymorphism. In L. parryae, blue flower color is determined by a single dominant allele. To disentangle the underlying diversity-maintaining mechanism from the mathematical complications associated with departures from Hardy-Weinberg genotype frequencies and dominance, we successively analyze a haploid model, a diploid model with three distinguishable genotypes, and a diploid model with complete dominance. For each model, we present conditions for the maintenance of a stable polymorphism, then use a diffusion approximation to describe the long-term fluctuations associated with these polymorphisms. Our protected polymorphism analyses show that a genotype whose arithmetic and geometric mean relative fitnesses are both less than one can persist if its relative fitness exceeds one in years that produce the most offspring. This condition is met by data from a population of L. parryae whose white morph has higher fitness (seed set) only in years of relatively heavy rain fall. The data suggest that the observed polymorphism may be explained by fluctuating selection. However, the yearly variation in flower color frequencies cannot be fully explained by our simple models, which ignore age structure and possible selection in the seed bank. We address two additional questions–one mathematical, the other biological–concerning the applicability of diffusion approximations to intense selection and the applicability of long-term predictions to datasets spanning decades for populations with long-lived seed banks.},

In the first effort to characterize in detail the population genetic structure and dynamics of wild Medicago species in China, a population genetic study of two closely related Medicago species, M. lupulina and M. ruthenica, that are distinct in these traits, are reported. These species are valuable germplasm resources for the improvement of Medicago forage crops but are under threat of habitat destruction. Methods Three hundred and twenty-eight individuals from 16 populations of the annual species, M. lupulina, and 447 individuals from 15 populations of the perennial species, M. ruthenica, were studied using 15 and 17 microsatellite loci, respectively. Conventional and Bayesian-clustering analyses were utilized to estimate population genetic structure, mating system and gene flow. Key Results Genetic diversity of M. lupulina (mean HE = 0·246) was lower than that of M. ruthenica (mean HE = 0·677). Populations of M. lupulina were more highly differentiated (FST = 0·535) than those of M. ruthenica (FST = 0·130). For M. lupulina, 55·5 \% of the genetic variation was partitioned among populations, whereas 76·6 \% of the variation existed within populations of M. ruthenica. Based on the genetic data, the selfing rates of M. lupulina and M. ruthenica were estimated at 95·8 \% and 29·5 \%, respectively. The genetic differentiation among populations of both species was positively correlated with geographical distance. Conclusions The mating system differentiation estimated from the genetic data is consistent with floral morphology and observed pollinator visitation. There was a much higher historical gene flow in M. ruthenica than in M. lupulina, despite more effective seed dispersal mechanisms in M. lupulina. The population genetic structure and geographical distribution of the two Medicago species have been shaped by life form, mating systems and seed dispersal mechanisms.},

As a specific example, we use a version of Levene's (1953) soft selection model, where stabilizing selection acts on a continuous trait within each of two habitats. If the optimal phenotypes within the habitats are sufficiently different, then two distinctly different alleles evolve gradually from a single ancestral allele. In a wide range of parameter values, the two locally optimal phenotypes will be realized by one of the homozygotes and the heterozygote, rather than by the two homozygotes. Unlike in the haploid analogue of the model, there can be multiple polymorphic evolutionary attractors with different probabilities of convergence. Our results differ from the population genetic models of short-term evolution in two aspects: (1) a polymorphism that is population genetically stable may be invaded by a new mutant allele and, as a consequence, the population may fall back to monomorphism, (2) long-term evolution by allele substitutions may lead from a population where polymorphism is not possible into one where polymorphism is possible.},

	abstract = {1. Invasive plants often have novel biotic interactions in their introduced ranges. These interactions, including less frequent herbivore attacks, may convey a competitive advantage over native plants. Invasive plants may vary in defence strategies (resistance vs. tolerance) or in response to the type of herbivore (generalists vs. specialists), but no study to date has examined this broad set of traits simultaneously.2. Here, we examined resistance and tolerance of Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera) populations from the introduced and native ranges to generalist (Cnidocampa flavescens) and specialist herbivores (Gadirtha inexacta) in the native range.3. In a field common-garden test of resistance, caterpillars of each species were raised on plants from native and invasive populations. We found the specialist grew larger on and consumed more mass of invasive plant populations than native populations, while the generalist showed the same performance between them. The results were consistent with our laboratory bioassay using excised leaves. Chemical analyses showed that the invasive plants had lower tannin content and higher ratio of carbohydrate to protein than those of their native counterparts, suggesting that plants from invasive populations have altered chemistry that has a larger impact on specialist than on generalist resistance.4. To test for differences in herbivore tolerance, plants were first defoliated by specialist or generalist herbivory and then allowed to regrow for 100 days in a field common garden. We found that plants from invasive populations had greater herbivore tolerance than native populations, especially for tolerance to generalists. They also grew more rapidly than native counterparts in the absence of herbivory.5. Synthesis. The results of these experiments indicate that differences in selective pressures between ranges have caused dramatic reductions in resistance to specialist herbivores and those changes in plant secondary chemistry likely underlie these differences. The greater tolerance of invasive populations to herbivory appears to at least partly reflect an increase in growth rate in the introduced range. The greater tolerance to generalist herbivores suggests the intriguing possibility of selection for traits that allow plants to tolerate generalist herbivores more than specialist herbivores.},

Here, we test the predictions that populations on the margins of a species’ distribution contain less genetic variation and are more differentiated than populations towards the core of the range by comparing patterns of genetic variation at five microsatellite loci between disjunct and core populations of the perennial, allohexaploid herb Geum triflorum. We sampled nine populations isolated on alvar habitat within the eastern Great Lakes region in North America, habitats that include disjunct populations of several plant species, and compared these to 16 populations sampled from prairie habitat throughout the core of the species’ distribution in midwestern Canada and the USA. Alvar populations exhibited much lower within-population diversity and contained only a subset of alleles found in prairie populations. We detected isolation by distance across the species’ range and within alvar and prairie regions separately. As predicted, genetic differentiation was higher among alvar populations than among prairie populations, even after controlling for the geographic distance between sampled populations. Low diversity and high differentiation can be accounted for by the greater contemporary spatial isolation of alvar populations. However, the genetic structure of alvar populations may also have been influenced by postglacial range expansion and contraction. Our results are consistent with alvar populations being founded during an expansion of prairie habitat during the warmer, hypsithermal period ∼5000 bp and subsequently becoming stranded on isolated alvar habitat as the climate grew cooler and wetter.},

	abstract = {Spatial distribution of palatable and unpalatable plants can influence the foraging behaviour of herbivores, thereby changing plant-damage probabilities. Moreover, the immediate proximity to certain plants can benefit other plants that grow below them, where toxicity or spines act as a physical barrier or concealment against herbivores. This paper presents the results of a multi-scale experiment performed to test the effect of shrubs as protectors of tree saplings against herbivores and the mechanism involved in Mediterranean ecosystems. We performed a factorial design in two mountain ranges, similar in physiognomy and vegetation, planting saplings of a palatable tree, the maple (Acer opalus subsp. granatense), and an unpalatable tree, the black pine (Pinus nigra), under three different types of shrubs. We considered four experimental microhabitats: highly palatable shrub (Amelanchier ovalis), palatable but spiny shrub (Crataegus monogyna or Prunus ramburii), unpalatable spiny shrub (Berberis vulgaris subsp. australis) and control (gaps of bare soil without shrubs). Three main factors were found to determine the probability of sapling attack: sapling palatability, experimental microhabitat and plot. Palatable saplings (maples) were browsed much more than unpalatable ones (pines). The degree of protection provided by the shrub proved greater as its palatability decreased with respect to sapling palatability, the unpalatable spiny shrub being the safest microhabitat for palatable saplings and bare soil for unpalatable ones. The differences found in number of attacked saplings between plots may be attributable to differences in herbivore pressure. The community context in which interaction takes place, namely the characteristics of the neighbours and the intensity of herbivore pressure, are determining factors for understanding and predicting the damage undergone by a target plant species. The mechanism that best explains these results is associational avoidance of saplings that grow near to unpalatable shrubs. It is necessary to introduce this neighbour effect in theoretical models and food-web approaches that analyse the plant–herbivore relationships, since it can strongly determine not only the intensity of the interaction, but also the spatial distribution and diversity of the plant community.},

In a field experiment, we measured the effects of milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) genotype and ants on milkweed arthropods. Populations of the ant‐tended aphid Aphis asclepiadis and the untended aphid Myzocallis asclepiadis varied eight‐ to 18‐fold among milkweed genotypes, depending on aphid species and whether ants were present. There was no milkweed effect on predatory arthropods. Ants increased Aphis abundance 59\%, decreased Myzocallis abundance 52\%, and decreased predator abundance 56\%. Milkweed genotype indirectly influenced ants via direct effects on Aphis and Myzocallis abundance. Milkweed genotype also modified ant‐aphid interactions, influencing the number of ants attracted per Aphis and Myzocallis. While ant effects on Myzocallis were consistently negative, effects on Aphis ranged from antagonistic to mutualistic among milkweed genotypes. As a consequence of milkweed effects on ant‐aphid interactions, ant abundance varied 13‐fold among milkweed genotypes, and monarch caterpillar survival was negatively correlated with genetic variation in ant abundance. We speculate that heritable variation in milkweed phloem sap drives these effects on aphids, ants, and caterpillars. In summary, milkweed exerts genetic control over the interactions between aphids and an ant that provides defense against foliage‐feeding caterpillars.},

	abstract = {Alien plant species can alter pollinator visitation and, in turn, the sexual reproduction of natives. Using a conventional and a phylogenetically controlled meta-analytical approach on a data set of 40 studies, we evaluated the effect of alien neighbour plant species (aliens) on visitation to and reproduction of native co-flowering focal species (focals), and compared such effect to that of native neighbours (natives). An overall significantly negative effect of aliens on visitation to and reproduction of focals was confirmed. Interestingly, aliens differed from natives in their effect on visitation, but not on reproductive success. The negative effect of aliens on visitation and reproductive success increased at high relative alien plant abundance, but this increase was proportionally lower than the increase in relative plant abundance. Likewise, effect of aliens on visitation and reproductive success was most detrimental when alien and focal species had similar flower symmetry or colour. The phylogenetic relatedness between alien neighbours and focals influenced the reproductive success effect size. Results of the phylogenetic meta-analysis were only partly consistent with those of the conventional meta-analysis, depending on the response variable and on whether we controlled for the phylogeny of neighbour or focal species, which calls for special attention to control for species relatedness in this type of review. This study demonstrates the predominant detrimental impact of alien plants on pollination and reproduction of natives, and highlights the importance of phenotypic similarity to the outcome of the interaction.},

	abstract = {Microgeographic genetic variation in populations of a wetland macrophyte, Hibiscus moscheutos L. (Malvaceae), was investigated using allozyme polymorphism. The species is a self-compatible insect-pollinated perennial, and seeds are water dispersed (hydrochory). Six hundred plants were analyzed from eight brackish and two freshwater populations within the Rhode River watershed/estuarine system. The genetic structure of the populations was assessed by fixation indices and spatial autocorrelation analyses. The degree of genetic differentiation among sites and gene flow between all paired combinations of sites (M ) was analyzed using three hypothetical gene flow models. Fixation indices indicated almost complete panmixia within populations, and spatial autocorrelations showed that genotypes were randomly distributed within sites, most likely the result of water dispersal of seeds. Allele frequencies were significantly different among sites, and estimated FST indicated moderate genetic differentiation (\_ = 0.062). Genetic differences between populations were mostly explained by a gene flow model that accounted for the location of populations relative to the tidal stream. The importance of hydrochory in affecting spatial genetic structure was thus suggested both within and among H. moscheutos populations.},

	abstract = {Many insects foraging for nectar or pollen exhibit flower constancy, a learned fidelity to a particular species of plant that previously provided a reward. Constancy may persist even when alternative flowers are available that provide a greater or less variable reward. This strategy entails more travelling time than one of generalization (visiting all suitable flowers as they are encountered). The consensus at present is that this increase in travelling time is offset by decreases in handling time; switching between flower species incurs a cost in time spent learning to [`]handle' the new flower species that is avoided by remaining constant. If this is so, then the optimal strategy should depend upon the density of flower species (and thus the travelling time), with switching occurring below a threshold density of the target flower species. This prediction is tested using the butterfly,Thymelicus flavus, by analysing foraging patterns under natural conditions. This species exhibited constancy: of 465 visits to flowers 85\% were to the same species as last visited. As predicted switches between flower species occurred in response to low encounter rates of the flower species on which the individual had previously fed. However, butterflies ignored the vast majority of suitable flowers that they encountered, even when they were of the species to which they were constant. This casts doubt on explanations for flower constancy as an adaptive strategy that minimizes handling time and maximizes resource acquisition per unit time within learning constraints.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/2459863},
	abstract = {Suppose we have a cline in gene frequency which results from spatially varying selection forces (which tend to establish the cline) opposed by gene flow (which tends to blur the cline). The characteristic width, W, of this gene frequency cline can be assessed qualitatively in terms of the parameters characterizing the selection and gene flow processes. We define Δ as the transition distance in the selection gradient, s as the maximum selection intensity (see fig. 1), l as the root-mean-square gene flow distance (see eq. [3]), and lc = l/ \${\textbackslash}textbackslashsqrt s\$ (see eq. [5]): then for Δ {\textbackslash}textless lc we have W ∼ lc, and consequently W {\textbackslash}textgreater Δ (as discussed fully by Slatkin 1973); conversely for Δ {\textbackslash}textgreater lc we have W ∼ (lc 2 Δ)1/3, and consequently lc {\textbackslash}textless W {\textbackslash}textless Δ. The former circumstance may be thought of as relatively strong gene flow and a relatively blurred cline (W {\textbackslash}textgreater Δ); the latter circumstance as relatively weak gene flow and a relatively sharp cline (W {\textbackslash}textless Δ). The above qualitative results pertain to all situations where the fitness of the heterozygotes, Aa, is intermediate between (or, in the event of a dominant allele A or a, coincident with one of) the homozygotes AA and aa. In particular, the detailed results of table 1 apply if the heterozygotes are of precisely intermediate fitness and table 2 applies if there is dominance, so that the heterozygote fitness coincides with one of the homozygotes. More generally, if the heterozygotes are at a strong disadvantage, measured by the selection parameter h of equation (15), the gene frequency cline is steepened and has typical width W ∼ l/ \${\textbackslash}textbackslashsqrt\{-h\}\$ . Conversely, strong heterozygous advantage leads to a very smooth cline and eventually to essentially equal frequencies of A and a at all points. The presence of asymmetry in the gene flow, as may easily arise from a prevailing wind or other environmental effect, can substantially modify the slope and position of a gene frequency cline. This can happen even when the characteristic scale length of the asymmetry (see eq. [22]) is relatively small. These results unify a large number of numerical simulations of such situations, some of which have been done for a stepped environmental gradient (effectively Δ {\textbackslash}textless lc) and others for a continuous selection gradient (effectively Δ {\textbackslash}textgreater lc). Some studies on real clines produced by the tension between selection and gene flow contain enough data to permit rough comparison with theory. The agreement between nature and qualitative theory is surprisingly good in several cases (see table 3). Field data of this sort are rare, as quantitative information about gene flow and about selective forces is difficult to get. The main aim of this paper is to present an orderly framework within which to assemble such data.},

	abstract = {Abstract Models accounting for genetic variation for resistance to herbivores within plant populations often postulate a balance between the costs of that resistance and its benefits. The production of glandular trichomes by Datura wrightii was shown to be costly in a previous one-year study because plants producing glandular trichomes (sticky plants), a factor conferring resistance to some insect herbivores, also produced 45\% fewer seeds than plants producing nonglandular trichomes (velvety plants) when grown in a common garden. Because sticky plants tended to be larger than velvety plants but produced fewer seed capsules, we postulated an allocation trade-off in which velvety plants are more reproduction-dominated whereas sticky plants are more growth-dominated. If a greater commitment to vegetative growth eventually allows sticky plants to compensate for reduced seed production, we would expect a reduction or elimination of the cost of resistance over time in this perennial plant. We monitored growth, survival, and seed production of plants from defined crosses of local populations for three years in a common garden when exposed to and protected from herbivores, and with and without supplemental water. The majority of plants exposed to herbivores had died by the end of the study. We used standard life-table methods to determine the net reproductive rate (R0) and the finite rate of increase (λ.) of plants of each trichome type. After three years, when plants were protected from herbivores, sticky plants were 187–245\% larger than velvety plants, depending upon irrigation treatment, but sticky plants continued to be less efficient in producing seeds per unit of canopy volume. Even though the total seed production of sticky plants eventually equaled that of velvety plants, the advantage of earlier reproduction by velvety plants increased λ. by 55–230\% over that of sticky plants, depending upon herbivore and irrigation treatment. Exposure to herbivores reduced A. by 69–83\%, depending upon plant type and irrigation treatment, whereas supplemental irrigation increased A. by 29–175\%, depending upon plant type and exposure to herbivores. Although there was a large allocation trade-off between growth and reproduction, the benefits of such a trade-off did not emerge before most plants were killed by herbivores. The cost of producing glandular trichomes strictly for herbivore resistance continued to exceed its benefits, and in the absence of other, unmeasured benefits from the suite of life-history characters associated with glandular trichome production, natural selection is expected to eliminate this costly resistance trait from D. wrightii populations.},

Fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda larvae grew more slowly on diet augmented with 10\% (dry wt) ripe fruits than on control diet with 10\% cellulose powder, and slower still on diet with nonripe fruits. However, survival, pupal weight and length of the pupal period were not affected by either treatment.

Temporal changes in the frequency of flowers with zero, one, and two lateral stamens were assessed during the flowering periods of a natural population and a garden-transplanted population in Japan. We conducted an experiment to evaluate how temperature regimes during flowering (15°/15°C and 15°/5°C) alter the number of stamens. The proportion of flowers with zero lateral stamens increased in both the natural and the garden-transplanted population as the flowering season progressed. In the growth experiment, lateral stamen numbers fluctuated even within individual inflorescences, but the frequency of flowers with zero lateral stamens was higher in the high-temperature condition than in the low-temperature condition. Temperature-dependent phenotypic plasticity is likely to be the cause of the field-observed variation in lateral stamen number for C. hirsuta. Developmentally unstable but partly temperature-dependent production of the lateral stamen may be an indication of some epigenetic regulations as an underlying mechanism.},

	abstract = {Among the numerous anti-herbivore defences developed by macroalgae, chemical and morphological traits are best documented and understood. Plant defence theory suggests that these resistances, which can either be constitutive or inducible, are associated with metabolic costs. They should therefore be impaired under conditions of energy limitation, but evidence for this prediction is scarce. In two subsequent experiments, we tested whether a reduction of light availability is changing feeding rates of the two mesoherbivores Idotea ochotensis and Lacuna smithii on the red alga Chondrus yendoi. Algal individuals were kept in outdoor mesocosm facilities for 10 days, during which we manipulated the amount of incoming sunlight at 6 levels (0\%–99\% reduction, i.e. 2000–20 μmol s− 1 m− 2). Orthogonal to this, we established the presence or absence of one of the herbivores to test whether C. yendoi can generate a defence. Algal palatability was investigated afterwards in no-choice feeding assays using naïve grazer individuals. The consumption of algal tissue in L. smithii increased with decreasing light, while this was not the case for I. ochotensis. However, we found a defence induced as a reaction to herbivory only by the highly mobile isopod but not when the slowly moving snail grazed on C. yendoi. Isopod total consumption rates in our experiments were 40 times higher than those of the gastropods. We therefore suggest that C. yendoi exhibits grazer-specific reactions to herbivory, depending on the mobility and voracity of the consumers. Interestingly, only for one of the grazers, i.e. the snail, short-term light reduction influenced the palatability of algal tissue. We discuss different but not mutually exclusive models that could explain this pattern. In conclusion, we view this three-species system as an illustrative example for specificity in grazer–algal interactions and their modification by environmental stress.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/3545769},
	abstract = {Herbivores may use various cues to detect the presence of anti-herbivore defences in plants. I analyse the effect of such signals on the selection for defences in four game theoretical models. In the models, plants can use either of the two strategies "defensive" and "non-defensive". The anti-herbivore defence decreases the risk of herbivore attack. Defended plants can produce a signal to inform potential herbivores of their defence status. Herbivores can either recognize the signal without any previous experience or they have to learn to recognize it, and undefended plants can or cannot reduce their risk of herbivore attack by associating with defended plants. The combination of these situations produces four qualitatively different cases. In all four models a signal is a prerequisite for the selection for defence. However, in none of them is it necessary that the signal gives perfect information to herbivores concerning the defence status of the plant. Thus, it should not be surprising if herbivores make mistakes and graze well-defended plants. The defensive strategy can only be a pure ESS (evolutionarily stable strategy) when herbivores recognize the signal without previous experience. When herbivores have to learn to recognize the signal the outcome depends on the initial proportions of defended and undefended plants in the population. This means that for a defended mutant to be able to invade a population of undefended plants the proportion of the defended type has to be higher than a certain critical value. Synergistic selection, through non-random association, or convergence of signal type, i.e. Müllerian mimicry, could make selection for defence possible in such cases. In the models where undefended plants can decrease their risk of herbivore attack by associating with defended plants the two strategies may coexist. These are the most likely situations for Batesian mimicry to evolve in, since the "model" and the potential "mimic" already coexist. Also, in these cases it is not a precondition that the defence and its signal are directly coupled. However, even if undefended plants can reduce their risk of herbivore attack by associating with defended plants, there is a possibility that the grazing cost is increased if undefended plants are found. Such an increase of the grazing cost for the undefended plants diminishes the possibilities for stable coexistence.},

	abstract = {Understanding the processes and patterns of gene flow and local adaptation requires a detailed knowledge of how landscape characteristics structure populations. This understanding is crucial, not only for improving ecological knowledge, but also for managing properly the genetic diversity of threatened and endangered populations. For nearly 80 years, population geneticists have investigated how physiognomy and other landscape features have influenced genetic variation within and between populations. They have relied on sampling populations that have been identified beforehand because most population genetics methods have required discrete populations. However, a new approach has emerged for analyzing spatial genetic data without requiring that discrete populations be identified in advance. This approach, landscape genetics, promises to facilitate our understanding of how geographical and environmental features structure genetic variation at both the population and individual levels, and has implications for ecology, evolution and conservation biology. It differs from other genetic approaches, such as phylogeography, in that it tends to focus on processes at finer spatial and temporal scales. Here, we discuss, from a population genetic perspective, the current tools available for conducting studies of landscape genetics.},

C. flexuosa (Cruciferae) is a facultative, vernalization-sensitive, long-day annual, and its phenology and the phenotypic expressions of many life history traits are largely controlled by photoperiod and vernalization in natural populations. We used plants from two populations which differed in their responses to chilling and photoperiod treatments. The timing of developmental processes was changed by controlling temperature and photoperiod regimes in growth chambers. Plasticity in size at maturity was analyzed as changes in a growth trajectory using two parameters, age at maturity (Δt) and growth rate (k). Both traits showed plasticity, but differences between the populations were found mostly for Δt. Distinctive differences in size at maturity of individuals in the two populations were mainly due to different amounts of plasticity in Δt. Variations in plasticity of nine other life history traits and their associations to age and size at maturity were also analyzed. Variation for eight of the traits can be described, at least in part, as a function of age and size at maturity for both populations, and most of the variation in the total number of seeds was explained by age and size at maturity. Only age at maturity had any effect on changes in resource allocation. The nine life history traits were integrated through associated character expressions with age and size at maturity. Changes in the association between a trait and age and/or size at maturity were rather conservative compared to changes in the plasticity of a trait between the two populations. Associations with age and size at maturity are mostly explicable in terms of inherent relationships in the developmental processes, and they may limit the ecological range expansion and the adaptive evolution of plasticity in C. flexuosa. The negative correlation between reproductive allocation and age at maturity can be a cost of delaying maturation in C. flexuosa.},

	abstract = {Abstract To date, theoretical or laboratory simulations of aposematic evolution in prey animals have focused narrowly on internally stored chemical defense as the source of unprofitability and ignore aposematic advertisement of physical defenses such as spines (and defensive hairs, claws, etc.). This has occurred even though aposematism in spiny animals has been recognized since the 19th century. In this paper we present the first detailed theoretical consideration of aposematism in spiny animals, focusing on questions of initial evolution, costs of display, and coevolution of displays with defenses. Using an individual-based evolutionary model, we found that spines (or similar physical defenses) can easily evolve without aposematism, but when spines do evolve, aposematic displays can also easily evolve if they help to make the prey animal distinctive and if they draw attention to the physical threat. When aposematic displays evolve, they cause reduced investment in costly spines, so that, in addition to signaling unprofitability, aposematic display may enhance the cost-effectiveness of antipredator defenses (one exception to this conclusion is if the display is itself as costly as the defense). For animals with stinging spines, combining physical and chemical defense, the evolution of aposematic display may lead to reduced investment in the toxin compared to the spine. This occurs because spines act as both secondary (repellent) defenses and as primary defenses (their own visible, honest advertisement), whereas internally stored toxins only (generally) act as repellent secondary defenses. We argue that conspicuous aposematism in spines functions as an attention-getting mechanism, whereas conspicuous aposematic display in purely toxic animals may be explained by signal reliability arguments. Finally, one (more) route by which aposematism may initially evolve is by spiny rather than purely chemically defended species, spreading to species with other forms of secondary defense as the signal becomes common.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/2657204},
	abstract = {Herbivores may affect plants by removing biomass, altering competitive interactions, and altering the abiotic environment. Changes in the size and quality of forage species and in species composition as a result of herbivory, in turn, affect future herbivory. We investigated the direct and indirect effects of herbivory by Brant Geese (Branta bernicla nigricans) on Triglochin palustris (arrowgrass) in a subarctic salt marsh in southwestern Alaska. In the first experiment, we compared arrowgrass in exclosed plots, unexclosed plots with feces removed, and control plots. In the second experiment, we used a full-factorial design to examine the effects of clipping arrowgrass, clipping neighboring plants, depositing goose feces, and their interactions on arrowgrass size and biomass allocation. In the third experiment, we placed hand-reared goslings on premanipulated plots from the second experiment to examine the effects of arrowgrass size, density, and species composition on the probability of an individual arrowgrass plant being grazed. For unclipped plants, feces deposition resulted in reduced bulb mass, reduced percentage of biomass in bulb and roots, and increased percentage of biomass in leaves, whereas feces deposition had no effect on clipped plants. Clipping neighbors resulted in increased arrowgrass root and stolon mass only for unclipped plants. Feces deposition resulted in increased vegetative reproduction when neighbors were clipped, but had no effect on vegetative reproduction when neighbors were not clipped. Plants in exclosed plots were larger, had greater allocation to leaves, had higher concentrations of C and N, and were more likely to flower than were plants in unexclosed plots. These results indicate an increase in competition for light with neighbor plants under feces deposition, which may be ameliorated by biomass removal of neighbors. Our results predict that an increase in grazing pressure is not necessarily detrimental to arrowgrass, provided that it is accompanied by increases in consumption of neighbor plants. The number of arrowgrass plants completely removed was not related to arrowgrass density, but the number of plants partially grazed increased with arrowgrass density. The probability that an individual arrowgrass plant would be grazed was negatively related to biomass or percent cover of several other species (Potentilla egedei, Chrysanthemum arcticum, Carex spp., Salix spp.). These results suggest that some neighbor species may provide a measure of protection (associational refuge) from herbivory, and that an increase in grazing intensity may have a strong negative effect on arrowgrass populations by reducing this protection and through an increased likelihood of consumption of the arrowgrass remaining after neighbors are removed. We conclude that the way in which we view neighboring plants (as competitors or potential protectors) affects our predictions regarding the effects of changing herbivore populations. Feedbacks from the plant community to herbivores following grazing should be included in studies that aim to extrapolate to the population level the effects of herbivory on individuals.},

	abstract = {Insect preferences for particular plant species might be subjected to trade-offs among several selective forces. Here, we evaluated, through laboratory and field experiments, the feeding and ovipositing preferences of the polyphagous leafminer Liriomyza huidobrensis (Diptera: Agromyzidae) in relation to adult and offspring performance and enemy-free space. Female leafminers preferred laying their eggs on Vicia faba (Fabaceae) over Beta vulgaris var. cicla (Chenopodiaceae), in both laboratory and field choice experiments, although no oviposition preference was observed in no-choice tests. Females fed more often on B. v. var. cicla (no-choice test) or showed no feeding preference (choice test), even when their realized fecundity was remarkably higher on V. faba. Offspring developed faster, tended to survive better, and attained bigger adult size on the preferred host plant. Also, a field experiment showed higher overall parasitism rates for leafminers developing on B. v. var. cicla, with a nonsignificant similar tendency in field surveys. According to these results, host plant selection by L. huidobrensis appears to be driven mainly by variation in host quality. Moreover, the consistent oviposition choices for the best host and the labile feeding preferences observed here, suggest that host plant selection might be driven by maximization of offspring fitness even without a conflict of interest between parents and offspring. Overall, these results highlight the complexity of decisions performed by phytophagous insects regarding their host plants, and the importance of simultaneous evaluation of the various driving forces involved, in order to unravel the adaptive significance of female choices.},

The concept has much explanatory power in studies of novel host associations, particularly when data suggest a deviation from optimal foraging theory, but is often overlooked in studies of herbivore host selection behaviour in favour of evolutionary hypotheses.3. In the present study, the concept was used to explain the unusual host selection behaviour of the New Zealand endemic oligophagous butterfly Lycaena salustius Fabricius, the larvae of which feed on endemic Polygonaceae species and the introduced and closely related Fagopyrum esculentum Moench.4. In field cage oviposition choice assays involving only endemic plants, females preferred to oviposit on the rare Muehlenbeckia astonii Petrie. However, the novel host F. esculentum was overwhelmingly preferred in an additional greenhouse assay. In larval no-choice performance assays, fitness indicators were variable for the novel host.5. This imperfect relationship between oviposition preference and larval performance is discussed as a possible example of ecological fitting and highlights the potential use of the concept as an explanatory tool in novel host selection behaviour studies.},

	abstract = {There has been an ongoing controversy over how to decide whether the distribution of species is “random” — i.e., whether it is not greatly different from what it would be if species did not interact. We recently showed (Roberts and Stone (1990)) that in the case of the Vanuatu (formerly New Hebrides) avifauna, the number of islands shared by species pairs was incompatible with a “random” null hypothesis. However, it was difficult to determine the causes or direction of the community's exceptionality. In this paper, the latter problem is examined further. We use Diamond's (1975) notion of checkerboard distributions (originally developed as an indicator of competition) and construct a C-score statistic which quantifies “checkerboardedness”. This statistic is based on the way two species might colonise a pair of islands; whenever each species colonises a different island this adds 1 to the C-score. Following Connor and Simberloff (1979) we generate a “control group” of random colonisation patterns (matrices), and use the C-score to determine their checkerboard characteristics. As an alternative mode of enquiry, we make slight alterations to the observed data, repeating this process many times so as to obtain another “control group”. In both cases, when we compare the observed data for the Vanuatu avifauna and the Antillean bat communities with that given by their respective “control group”, we find that these communities have significantly large checkerboard distributions, making implausible the hypothesis that their species distributions are a product of random colonisation.},

Our results indicate that the transcriptome dynamics are predominantly governed by endogenous diurnal rhythms, ambient temperature, plant age, and solar radiation. The data revealed diurnal gates for environmental stimuli to influence transcription and pointed to relative influences exerted by circadian and environmental factors on different metabolic genes. The model also generated predictions for the influence of changing temperatures on transcriptome dynamics. We anticipate that our models will help translate the knowledge amassed in laboratories to problems in agriculture and that our approach to deciphering the transcriptome fluctuations in complex environments will be applicable to other organisms.},

	abstract = {In two Japanese cicadas, Cryptotympana facialis and Graptopsaltria nigrofuscata, with different habitat distributions, fully developed embryos hatch in response to high humidity due to rainfall. Despite the advantage of hatching on rainy days, this trait burdens embryos with an extra period of desiccation until the unpredictable advent of rain. We compared the ability of the fully developed embryos of these cicadas to endure periods of low humidity. Eggs were exposed to a combination of different humidities (43\% and 75\% relative humidity, RH) and durations (0–15 days), and then transferred to an environment with 100\% RH to stimulate hatching. In both species, total hatching rates decreased as duration increased, although there was no significant effect of humidity. In C. facialis, a considerable proportion of the eggs hatched during the desiccation period, and the hatching rate was higher at 75\% RH than at 43\% RH. After transfer to 100\% RH, most hatching occurred within a day regardless of the desiccation level. In G. nigrofuscata, no nymphs hatched during the desiccation periods. However, more eggs required more than a day after transfer to 100\% RH to hatch after desiccation at 43\% RH than at 75\% RH. Consequently, the overall proportion of timely hatching of eggs (eggs hatching within a day of moisture supply) was higher after desiccation at 43\% RH in C. facialis, but it was higher after desiccation at 75\% RH in G. nigrofuscata. These different physiological responses of the two species may reflect adaptation to habitat dryness.},

	abstract = {Heritable phenotypic variation in plants can be caused not only by underlying genetic differences, but also by variation in epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation. However, we still know very little about how relevant such epigenetic variation is to the ecology and evolution of natural populations. We conducted a greenhouse experiment in which we treated a set of natural genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana with the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine and examined the consequences of this treatment for plant traits and their phenotypic plasticity. Experimental demethylation strongly reduced the growth and fitness of plants and delayed their flowering, but the degree of this response varied significantly among genotypes. Differences in genotypes’ responses to demethylation were only weakly related to their genetic relatedness, which is consistent with the idea that natural epigenetic variation is independent of genetic variation. Demethylation also altered patterns of phenotypic plasticity, as well as the amount of phenotypic variation observed among plant individuals and genotype means. We have demonstrated that epigenetic variation can have a dramatic impact on ecologically important plant traits and their variability, as well as on the fitness of plants and their ecological interactions. Epigenetic variation may thus be an overlooked factor in the evolutionary ecology of plant populations.},

	abstract = {Endophytic fungi, particularly in the genus Neotyphodium, are thought to interact mutualistically with host grasses primarily by deterring herbivores and pathogens via production of alkaloidal mycotoxins. Little is known, however, about how these endophytes interact with host plants and herbivores outside the realm of agronomic forage grasses, such as tall fescue, and their livestock grazers or invertebrate pest herbivores. We tested the effects of Neotyphodium inhabiting introduced tall fescue and native Arizona fescue on preference, survival, and performance of the leaf-cutting ant, Acromyrmex versicolor, an important generalist herbivore in the southwestern United States. In a choice experiment, we determined preferences of foraging queens and workers for infected and uninfected tall fescue and Arizona fescue. In a no-choice experiment, we determined queen survival, worker production, and size of fungal gardens for foundress queens reared on diets of infected and uninfected tall fescue and Arizona fescue. Foraging workers and queens did not significantly prefer either uninfected tall fescue or Arizona fescue relative to infected grasses, although ants tended to harvest more uninfected than infected tall fescue and more infected than uninfected Arizona fescue. Queen survivorship and length of survival was greater on uninfected tall fescue, uninfected Arizona fescue, and infected Arizona fescue than on infected tall fescue or the standard diet of palo verde and mesquite leaves. No queens survived beyond 6 weeks of the study when fed the infected tall fescue diet, in contrast to the effects of the other diets. Likewise, worker production was much lower and fungal garden size much smaller on infected tall fescue than in all other treatments, including the standard diet. In general, ant colonies survived and performed better on uninfected tall fescue and infected and uninfected Arizona fescue than standard diets of palo verde and mesquite leaves. The interaction of Neotyphodium with its host grasses is highly variable and these endophytes may increase, not alter, or even decrease resistance to herbivores. The direction of the interaction depends on host and fungal genotype, herbivore species, and environmental factors. The presence of endophytes in most, if not all, host plants suggests that endophytes may alter foraging patterns, performance, and survival of herbivores, such as leaf-cutting ants, but not always in ways that increase host plant fitness.},

Insects can locate their hosts even though the host plants are often hidden among an array of other plants. Plant volatiles play an important role in this host-location process. The recognition of a host plant by these olfactory signals could occur by using either species-specific compounds or specific ratios of ubiquitous compounds. Currently, most studies favor the second scenario, with strong evidence that plant discrimination is due to central processing of olfactory signals by the insect, rather than their initial detection. Furthermore, paired or clustered olfactory receptor neurons might enable fine-scale spatio-temporal resolution of the complex signals encountered when ubiquitous compounds are used.},

	abstract = {Author SummarySince Charles Darwin recognized the extraordinary diversity of plant mating systems, deciphering their origins has been a central theme for evolutionary biologists. Among various sexual systems, the evolution of self-fertilization (selfing) from cross-fertilization is one of the most frequent transitions in flowering plants, but the genetic basis responsible for these changes is still poorly understood. Here, we have focused on the evolution of selfing in the Brassicaceae, where cross-fertilization is usually enforced by a self-incompatibility (SI) system, determining specific recognition between the pistil (female component) and the pollen (male component). Through sequencing analysis and crossing experiments, we studied the genetic changes leading to the loss of SI in the selfing species Arabidopsis kamchatica. We found that the female components of the SI system remain functional in many accessions, suggesting that degradation of the male component was responsible for the loss of SI. Recent studies in the Brassicaceae suggest that such a male-driven loss of SI is more common in wild than in cultivated populations. Furthermore, this pattern is consistent with theories predicting that mutations disabling male specificity have a higher probability of leading to successful mating and are thus more likely to spread than those disabling female specificity.},

	abstract = {Associational resistance, which refers to decreased herbivory experienced by a plant growing with heterospecific neighbors, is a well documented ecological phenomenon. In contrast, studies that describe increased herbivory due to heterospecific neighbors (associational susceptibility) are relatively rare. In this study we document associational susceptibility among hosts of the fall cankerworm (Alsophila pometaria). Cottonwoods (Populus angustifolia × P. fremontii) located under box elder (Acer negundo) were colonized by two to three times more cankerworms, and suffered two to three times greater defoliation than cottonwoods growing under mature cottonwoods, or cottonwoods growing in the open. This associational pattern reflects fall cankerworm's strong preference for box elder over cottonwood: egg densities were 26 times greater on box elder than cottonwood, first instar larvae consumed 75 times more box elder than cottonwood in larval palatability trials, and fourth instar larvae consumed three times more box elder than cottonwood. In terms of larval performance, first instar larvae exhibited approximately six times greater mortality and 40\% slower development time on cottonwood relative to box elder, whereas fourth instar larval performance did not differ between the hosts. Based on these and other findings, we predict that, when generalist herbivores reach outbreak proportions and consume their preferred hosts, they will then move to nearby less-preferred hosts to complete their life cycle. This "spillover" effect will result in associational susceptibility for less-preferred hosts and is likely common in forest outbreak situations where herbivore densities are high. With increased emphasis on diversified plantings in agriculture and forestry, it is important to understand potential drawbacks such as associational susceptibility.},

	abstract = {1. To elucidate the factors responsible for the evolution of host specialisation, prey capture performance in hatchlings of two sibling ladybird species, Harmonia yedoensis and H. axyridis, feeding on four aphid species was examined. Harmonia yedoensis is a specialist predator that preys only on pine aphids in the field, whereas H. axyridis is a generalist predator with a broad prey range.2. In H. yedoensis, sibling cannibalism in each clutch was intense and predation against pine aphid as well as other aphid species was moderately successful. In contrast, the predation success rate of H. axyridis against pine aphid was quite low.3. Moreover, it was experimentally shown that increased maternal investment enhanced prey capture performance against pine aphid in H. yedoensis but not in H. axyridis hatchlings, despite their increased body size due to maternal investment.4. In addition, morphological and behavioural analysis showed that hatchlings of H. yedoensis had longer legs and a larger head capsule size and could walk faster than H. axyridis.5. In summary, the interactive effects between a large amount of maternal investment and morphological specialisation of the first instars may enable H. yedoensis to capture the pine aphid efficiently, a highly elusive prey for ladybird hatchlings. The ability of H. yedoensis to utilise the three other aphid species in addition to the pine aphid suggests that a trade-off in prey capture performance is not the main factor in the host specialisation of H. yedoensis.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/2679814},
	abstract = {In 1996, we investigated the female reproductive success of the narrow endemic Erodium paularense in a population with a mixture of rock and lithosol microhabitats. The main purposes of this study were to determine the main factors that affected reproductive success and whether these factors were influenced by differences in the two contrasting microhabitats. In both microhabitats, fruit set was low, and seed abortion rates were very high. Lithosol plants were larger and had higher flower, fruit, and seed production than rock plants. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the effects of plant size, phenological variables, competition, and flowering synchrony on fecundity and to compare path coefficients among microhabitats. In both microhabitats reproductive success was strongly predicted by plant size and to a lesser extent by flowering synchrony. Flowering moment and intensity did not have a significant effect on fruit set, suggesting that pollinator availability is not a limiting factor in total seed production. This was further corroborated by hand-pollination experiments. Resource limitations, inbreeding depression, and environmental restrictions may be responsible for the high rates of seed abortion. Multisample comparison of path coefficients for the two microhabitats rejected the possibility that reproductive patterns could be described by one single model. The main divergences in both microhabitat models were related to competition. Reproductive data from 1995, a year with below-average rainfall, showed remarkably lower seed production at the lithosol microhabitat and similar values at the rock microhabitat as compared to 1996. The variation of the reproductive parameters between the two years was evaluated by multisample analyses in which 1995 data were fed into the 1996 models. At the lithosol microhabitat, two constrained paths involving seed production produced a significant decrease in fit, whereas at the rock microhabitat, significant differences were found in three paths involving only phenological variables. Thus, the lithosol microhabitat may contribute to greater seed production in favorable years while the rock microhabitat may provide more stable conditions over time.},

	abstract = {Background Trait polymorphism can evolve as a consequence of frequency-dependent selection. Coevolutionary interactions between hosts and parasites may lead to selection on both to evolve extreme phenotypes deviating from the norm, through disruptive selection. Methodology/Principal finding Here, we show through detailed field studies and experimental procedures that the ashy-throated parrotbill (Paradoxornis alphonsianus) and its avian brood parasite, the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus), have both evolved egg polymorphism manifested in discrete immaculate white, pale blue, and blue egg phenotypes within a single population. In this host-parasite system the most common egg colours were white and blue, with no significant difference in parasitism rates between hosts laying eggs of either colour. Furthermore, selection on parasites for countering the evolution of host egg types appears to be strong, since ashy-throated parrotbills have evolved rejection abilities for even partially mimetic eggs. Conclusions/Significance The parrotbill-cuckoo system constitutes a clear outcome of disruptive selection on both host and parasite egg phenotypes driven by coevolution, due to the cost of parasitism in the host and by host defences in the parasite. The present study is to our knowledge the first to report the influence of disruptive selection on evolution of discrete phenotypes in both parasite and host traits in an avian brood parasitism system.},

Spatial genetic structure was also investigated.• A mean self-pollen rate of 90.2\% was observed at the pollination stage, but a low selfing rate of 0.3\% was observed at the seed stage. In outcross events, however, pairwise distance and relatedness between maternal and paternal parents were not different between pollination and seed stages.

This rearrangement step generates simple nitriles, epithionitriles, or isothiocyanates, depending on the structure of the parent glucosinolate and the presence of proteins that promote specific structural outcomes. Glucosinolate accumulation and myrosinase activity differ by plant age and tissue type and respond to environmental stimuli such as planting density and herbivory; however, the influence of these factors on the structural outcome of the rearrangement step remains unknown. We show that the structural outcome of glucosinolate activation is controlled by interactions among plant age, planting density, and natural genetic variation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) rosette leaves using six well-studied accessions. We identified a similarly complex interaction between tissue type and the natural genetic variation present within these accessions. This raises questions about the relative importance of these novel levels of regulation in the evolution of plant defense. Using mutants in the structural specifier and glucosinolate activation genes identified previously in Arabidopsis rosette leaves, we demonstrate the requirement for additional myrosinases and structural specifiers controlling these processes in the roots and seedlings. Finally, we present evidence for a novel EPITHIOSPECIFIER PROTEIN-independent, simple nitrile-specifying activity that promotes the formation of simple nitriles but not epithionitriles from all glucosinolates tested.},

After seed set, the dry weight of the plants was determined and the amount of seeds produced was calculated from an established linear relationship. The two genotypes were found to be ecologically different; the susceptible genotype was the strongest competitor (significantly so in the absence of the disease), whereas the resistant genotype produced most seeds. The competitive ability of the disease resistant A.thaliana genotype increased significantly in the presence of a P. parasitica isolate when competing with the susceptible A.thaliana genotype, whereas the disease did not affect the competitive ability of the susceptible genotype significantly. Assuming that the population only consisted of the two genotypes and mainly was affected by the disease it was possible to predict the probabilities of four long-term ecological scenarios. Without the disease the most likely long-term ecological scenario was that the two A.thaliana genotypes would coexist, whereas, in the presence of the disease, the resistant genotype most likely would outcompete the susceptible genotype.},

Feeding on fresh leaves resulted in 100\% mortality of larvae after 26 days of unsubstantial growth. The extract exhibited strong antifeedant and toxic activity against the larvae when applied either on leaf discs or incorporated into artificial diet. Under choice conditions the antifeedant index calculated over 72 h for neonate larvae increased significantly (from 71.5 ± 3.2 to 92.1 ± 4.2) as the concentration of extract in the treated diet increased from 200 to 1000 ppm. Consumption by the sixth instar larvae of leaf discs dipped in 0.01, 0.1 and 0.2\% extract solutions was significantly lower than consumption of control discs in both choice and no-choice tests. The latter two concentrations deterred feeding by 63.4 and 90.4\%, respectively, under choice conditions, while only the 0.2\% extract solution deterred feeding by 56.8\% in the no-choice test. Toxicity of the extracts was manifested by a high mortality, reduced growth rates, and low weight gain by larvae fed on diets containing 200–2000 ppm of the extract. No larvae survived to pupation under the latter concentration. The time to pupation increased from 15.8 ± 0.4 to 37.9 ± 4.1 days as the extract concentration in diet increased from 0 to 1000 ppm. When fed to the fifth instar larvae, the crude extract significantly reduced consumption, growth, utilization of ingested and digested food, and approximate digestibility. The consumption-dependent growth efficiency of animals fed on extract-free diet was significantly higher than the growth efficiency of animals fed on extract-containing diets, suggesting both antifeedant and toxic activities of the extract.},

	abstract = {Plants flower in particular seasons even in natural, fluctuating environments. The molecular basis of temperature-dependent flowering-time regulation has been extensively studied, but little is known about how gene expression is controlled in natural environments. Without a memory of past temperatures, it would be difficult for plants to detect seasons in natural, noisy environments because temperature changes occurring within a few weeks are often inconsistent with seasonal trends. Our 2-y census of the expression of a temperature-dependent flowering-time gene, AhgFLC, in a natural population of perennial Arabidopsis halleri revealed that the regulatory system of this flowering-time gene extracts seasonal cues as if it memorizes temperatures over the past 6 wk. Time-series analysis revealed that as much as 83\% of the variation in the AhgFLC expression is explained solely by the temperature for the previous 6 wk, but not by the temperatures over shorter or longer periods. The accuracy of our model in predicting the gene expression pattern under contrasting temperature regimes in the transplant experiments indicates that such modeling incorporating the molecular bases of flowering-time regulation will contribute to predicting plant responses to future climate changes.},

While many studies have focused on such tritrophic interactions, few have investigated effects of HIPV on herbivores. I used natural herbivores of wild Lima bean and studied their responses to jasmonic acid-induced plants in an olfactometer and in feeding trials. Both Cerotoma ruficornis and Gynandrobrotica guerreroensis (Chrysomelidae) significantly preferred control plants to induced ones in the olfactometer, and they avoided feeding on induced plants. In contrast, Curculionidae significantly preferred HIPV of the induced plant to those of the control in one plant pair and did not choose in the case of a second pair. In feeding trials, no choice occurred in the first plant pair, while control leaves were preferred in the second. Release of HIPV deterred Chrysomelid herbivores and, thus, acted as a direct defense. This may be an important addition to indirect defensive effects. Whether or not HIPV released by induced plants attracted herbivorous Curculionidae, thus incurring ecological costs, varied among plants. Such differences could be related to various HIPV blends released by individual plants.},

Many of these compounds contribute to the characteristic aroma of tomato foliage and constitute a key part of the language by which plants communicate with other organisms in natural environments. Here, we describe a novel recessive mutation called odorless-2 (od-2) that was identified on the basis of an altered leaf-aroma phenotype. od-2 plants exhibit pleiotrophic phenotypes, including alterations in the morphology, density, and chemical composition of glandular trichomes. Type VI glandular trichomes isolated from od-2 leaves accumulate only trace levels of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and flavonoids. Other foliar defensive compounds, including acyl sugars, glycoalkaloids, and jasmonate-regulated proteinase inhibitors, are produced in od-2 leaves. Growth of od-2 plants under natural field conditions showed that the mutant is highly susceptible to attack by an indigenous flea beetle, Epitrix cucumeris, and the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata. The increased susceptibility of od-2 plants to Colorado potato beetle larvae and to the solanaceous specialist Manduca sexta was verified in no-choice bioassays. These findings indicate that Od-2 is essential for the synthesis of diverse trichome-borne compounds and further suggest that these compounds influence host plant selection and herbivore community composition under natural conditions.},

	abstract = {The availability of detailed environmental data, together with inexpensive and powerful computers, has fueled a rapid increase in predictive modeling of species environmental requirements and geographic distributions. For some species, detailed presence/absence occurrence data are available, allowing the use of a variety of standard statistical techniques. However, absence data are not available for most species. In this paper, we introduce the use of the maximum entropy method (Maxent) for modeling species geographic distributions with presence-only data. Maxent is a general-purpose machine learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and it has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modeling. In order to investigate the efficacy of the method, here we perform a continental-scale case study using two Neotropical mammals: a lowland species of sloth, Bradypus variegatus, and a small montane murid rodent, Microryzomys minutus. We compared Maxent predictions with those of a commonly used presence-only modeling method, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP). We made predictions on 10 random subsets of the occurrence records for both species, and then used the remaining localities for testing. Both algorithms provided reasonable estimates of the species’ range, far superior to the shaded outline maps available in field guides. All models were significantly better than random in both binomial tests of omission and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was almost always higher for Maxent, indicating better discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for the species. The Maxent modeling approach can be used in its present form for many applications with presence-only datasets, and merits further research and development.},

The GSLs indentified included five alkenyl GSLs (progoitrin, glucoraphanin, sinigrin, gluconapin, and glucobrassicanapin), two indolyl GSLs (4-hydroxyglucobrassicin and glucobrassicin), and one aromatic GSL (gluconasturtiin). The total GSL content in the ten cultivars ranged from 36 to 187 mmol kg-1 DW. The content of indolylglucosinolate (GSL) ranged widely from 0.4 to 8.2 mmol kg-1 DW, which accounted for 0.5 to 10.2\%, respectively, of the total GSL content. Although the total GSL content was affected by the harvest dates, the proportion of individual GSLs did not change significantly. Furthermore, the proportion of the individual GSL content between edible parts and seeds in vegetable turnip rapevaried considerably, especially for gluconapin and glucobrassicanapin. Among them, the sum of the contents of gluconapin and glucobrassicanapin accounted for more than 65\% of the total GSL content in nine vegetable turnip rape cultivars except for cv. Husanohana in which the percentages of gluconapin and glucobrassicanapin of total GSL was less than 53\%. The proportion of progoitrin as a percentage of the total GSL content was markably different between vegetable turnip rape and rapeseed (B. napus L.), namely 1 and 48\%, respectively. As a result, it was difficult to predict the individual GSL content in edible parts compare to those in the seeds analyzed.},

We give the approximate sampling distribution of the log response ratio, discuss why it is a particularly useful metric for many applications in ecology, and demonstrate how to use it in meta-analysis.

	abstract = {Gene flow was investigated in a natural population of Lotus corniculatus L. (Fabaceae) using a combination of pollen and seed dispersal studies and a recombinant DNA technique. The population is spatially heterogeneous and grows with Empetrum nigrum. L. corniculatus is pollinated by the pollen-collecting bumblebee Bombus lapidarius L. Most pollinator flights occurred within patches, as bees usually visit nearest-neighbour plants, show no marked directionality, and forage mostly within patches. Gene flow by seeds is also limited, reinforcing the pattern of gene flow within patches. However, 2.6\% of pollinator flights are between patches and considerable pollen carryover also occurs. Thus, gene flow between patches is potentially sufficient to retard or prevent genetic differentiation in spite of the patchy sub-structuring of the population. A sub-set of the population was analysed for restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) to document the actual gene flow pattern of the population. The DNA analysis revealed significant levels of genetic differentiation between the patches. The level of gene flow that can be inferred from the distribution of genetic variation is surprisingly restricted, as compared to gene flow inferred from pollinator behaviour, and emphasizes that stochastic processes like genetic drift and founder effects may have a strong impact on the prevailing genetic structure.},

	abstract = {Abstract 1. The possible effect of juvenile imprinting or ‘chemical legacy’ on the subsequent oviposition – often called the ‘Hopkins’ host selection principle’– has been a controversial but recurrent theme in the literature on host-plant preference. While it appears possible in principle, experimental support for the hypothesis is equivocal. The present study points out that it is also important to consider its theoretical implications, and asks under what circumstances, if any, it should be favoured by natural selection.2. Following this reasoning, it is predicted that host preference in the polyphagous butterfly Polygonia c-album L. (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae) should not be influenced by larval environment. This was tested by rearing larvae on three natural host plants: the high-ranked Urtica dioica and the medium-ranked Salix cinerea and Ribes uva-crispa, and exposing the naive females to oviposition choices involving the same set of plants.3. It was found that larval host plant had no effect on oviposition decisions of the adult female. Hence, the Hopkins’ host selection principle does not seem to be applicable in this species.4. Based on recent insights on how accuracy of environmental versus genetic information should affect the control of developmental switches, the conditions that could favour the use of juvenile cues in oviposition decisions are discussed. Although the Hopkins’ host selection hypothesis cannot be completely ruled out, we argue that the circumstances required for it to be adaptive are so specific that it should not be invoked as a general hypothesis for host selection in plant-feeding insects.},

	abstract = {The reproductive biology of Impatiens pallida Nuttal and Impatiens biflora Walt (Balsaminaceae) was studied in relation to the evolutionary significance of cleistogamy and chasmogamy. Plant survivorship varied markedly between sites and was affected by abiotic agents such as drought and flooding, and occasional heavy damage from host-specific herbivores. Cleistogamy was the dominant mode of reproduction at all sites, but absolute and relative chasmogam production generally increased with total bud output. Extreme variability in seed production and reproductive mode was observed within and between sites. Cleistogams produced fewer seeds per ovary, matured faster and had a greater probability of surviving to produce seeds than chasmogams in all populations. The energetic investment in fertilization costs (i.e., sepals, petals, pollen and nectar) of chasmogams was {\textbackslash}textgreater100 times that of cleistogams. Calculation of energetic expenditure per seed based on survivorship curves for each flower type and energy investment for major developmental stages indicated chasmogams were 2-3 times as costly as cleistogams. Greater chasmogam cost was also suggested by the earlier onset of senescence in greenhouse plants with high relative chasmogam output. Plants grown in the greenhouse under different light regimes displayed extreme plasticity in reproductive response as measured by absolute and relative output of cleistogams and chasmogams. The proportion of chasmogams produced per plant generally increased with light intensity. Plants collected from I. pallida populations where chasmogamy was rarely observed had significant chasmogam production when grown in the greenhouse. The tremendous differences observed in plant survivorship and reproductive output demonstrate a high degree of temporal and spatial variation in quality of Impatiens habitats. It is suggested that these conditions have exerted strong selective pressure for reproductive plasticity. Multipurpose genotypes capable of producing cleistogams and chasmogams, depending on habitat suitability, are highly adaptive in environments where genetic tracking is inefficient. The evolution of a dual reproductive mode in Impatiens provides seed production at minimal expense via cleistogamy and the opportunity for outcrossing and pollen donation through chasmogamy. The outcrossing potential of Impatiens chasmogams is enhanced by (1) functional monoecy and (2) a fivefold difference in relative lifespans (@M phase {\textbackslash}textgreater @V), which results in strongly skewed intraplant sex ratios.},

The effects on S. lepidus of three red clover T. pratense lines, selected for high, medium, or low levels of the isoflavone formononetin in foliage, were compared in three experiments using white clover as a control. In a no-choice slant board experiment, weevil larval weights were greater for larvae feeding on white clover roots than those feeding on roots of the red clovers. The effect of larval root herbivory on plant growth was similar for all four clovers. Following root herbivory, a large increase in root and shoot formononetin levels was observed in the high-formononetin selection of red clover but little change in the low-formononetin red clover. In a no-choice experiment with sexually mature female adult weevils feeding on foliage of the four clovers, all the red clovers had increased weevil mortality. Female weevils eating the high-formononetin red clover laid fewer eggs than weevils eating white clover. The red clover diet caused a large accumulation of abdominal fat and/or oil in the weevils, whereas weevils feeding on white clover did not accumulate fat/oil. When sexually immature adult weevils were given a choice of foliage from all four clovers, white clover was eaten preferentially, and the low-formononetin red clover was preferred to the high-formononetin red clover. The results suggest that formononetin and associated metabolites in red clover may act as chemical defences against adult S. lepidus and that distribution in forage legumes can be manipulated by plant breeding to improve root health.},

	abstract = {The predator Orius sauteri (Poppius) (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) is an effective arthropod natural enemy of thrips, especially Thrips palmi Karny (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), a serious pest of vegetables. First, we studied O. sauteri's response to the odour from thrips-infested eggplant [Solamum melongena L. (Solanaceae)] in a laboratory by two-choice experiments using a Y-tube olfactometer. When detached eggplant leaves were used as odour sources, O. sauteri preferred the volatiles from uninfested leaves to clean air. Concerning preferences among differently infested leaves, O. sauteri preferred the volatiles from plants infested with 10–100 thrips per leaf to uninfested leaves, but showed no significant preference for artificially damaged leaves over uninfested leaves. Similar results were obtained when complete plants were tested as the odour source. Second, release and recapture experiments in a greenhouse, a more realistic set of conditions, were conducted to confirm whether a significant preference for infested plants occurred at similar infestation levels as in the laboratory. Trends favouring infested plants were detected at densities of five and 500 thrips per plant; however, at the five thrips per plant, this trend was due to the large deviation seen in infested plants in only one replicate. In light of the low tolerable thrips density of eggplant, it is necessary to confirm whether artificial treatments with chemicals induce the emission of herbivore-induced plant volatiles that can attract O. sauteri and prolong its residence time on the leaf.},

	abstract = {The leaf beetle Plagiodera versicolora (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is a specialist herbivore, all of whose mobile stages feed on the leaves of salicaceous plants. Both the larval and adult stages of the ladybird Aiolocaria hexaspilota (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) are dominant natural enemies of the larvae of the leaf beetle. To clarify the role of plant volatiles in prey-finding behaviour of A. hexaspilota, the olfactory responses of the ladybird in a Y-tube olfactometer are studied. The ladybird adults show no preference for willow plants Salix eriocarpa that are infested by leaf beetle adults (nonprey) over that for intact plants but move more to the willow plants infested by leaf beetle larvae (prey) than to intact plants. Moreover, ladybird larvae show no preference for willow plants infested by leaf beetle larvae or adults over intact plants. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, six volatile compounds are released in larger amounts in the headspace of willow plants infested by leaf beetle larvae than in the headspace of willow plants infested by leaf beetle adults. In addition, the total amount of volatiles emitted from willow plants that are either intact or infested by leaf beetle adults is much smaller than that from willow plants infested by leaf beetle larvae. These results indicate that volatiles from S. eriocarpa infested by P. versicolora inform A. hexaspilota adults about the presence of the most suitable stage of their prey, whereas A. hexaspilota larvae do not use such information.},

In Arabidopsis lyrata, Arabidopsis halleri and Arabidopsis arenosa, traits pertaining to self-incompatibility, heavy metal tolerance and inter-specific hybridization have been subjected to detailed genetic analysis. However, the full potential for exploring the causes and consequences of natural variation in complex traits within the genus Arabidopsis has not been widely appreciated or realized. Here, we draw on broadly dispersed information to characterize the basic biology, ecology, population genetics and molecular evolution for these three non-model Arabidopsis species. We illustrate how the wealth of functional and genomic tools pioneered in A. thaliana can be applied to gain insights into adaptive evolution of ecologically important traits and genome-wide processes, such as polyploidy, speciation and reticulate evolution, within and among Arabidopsis species.},

	abstract = {Allocation theory suggests that the optimal level of resistance against herbivores should vary with the risk of herbivory if allocation to resistance is costly. The perennial herb Arabidopsis lyrata has a genetically based polymorphism for trichome production and occurs in a glabrous and a trichome-producing form. Leaf trichomes (hairs) can protect plants against insect herbivores, and may increase tolerance to drought and UV-radiation. To examine the functional significance of trichome production, we documented the frequency of glabrous plants and damage by insect herbivores in 30 A. lyrata populations in Sweden and Norway. The proportion of glabrous plants ranged from 0.10 to 0.71 (median=0.44) in polymorphic populations; 7 of 12 populations in Norway and 14 of 18 populations in Sweden were monomorphic glabrous, i.e. with fewer than 5\% trichome-producing plants. The mean proportion of the leaf area removed by herbivores varied substantially among populations and years. With few exceptions, glabrous plants were more damaged than trichome-producing plants in polymorphic populations. The intensity of herbivory quantified as the mean damage to glabrous plants tended to be higher in polymorphic populations than in populations monomorphic for the glabrous morph and was higher in Sweden than in Norway. In Norway, both the magnitude of herbivore damage and the frequency of trichome-producing plants tended to decrease with increasing altitude. The results indicate that leaf trichomes contribute to resistance against herbivorous insects in A. lyrata, and suggest that herbivore-mediated selection contributes to the maintenance of the polymorphism in trichome production.},

(2) How can this generalization be used to detect different strengths and directions in trait selection at the meta-community and local community levels? Methods I describe a decomposition of the deviance between observed and predicted relative abundances based on a maximum entropy model including a meta-community prior (CATS) and generalize a previous decomposition of relative abundance using this model; corrections to avoid negative explained proportions of deviance are presented. Simulations of community assembly are used to explore its properties and elucidate its interpretation. In particular, this method quantifies the proportion of the total deviance between observed and predicted relative abundances attributed to: (1) pure trait-based local selection, (2) dispersal mass effect from the meta-community, (3) joint contributions of (1) and (2) that cannot be separated; and (4) residual deviance due to demographic stochasticity. Results and Conclusions The previous decomposition, while giving correct values in that particular data set, requires modification in order to avoid nonsensical negative values. When the modifications described in this paper are made, the decomposition provides correct values. Furthermore, positive or negative values of the joint composition inform us of the importance and direction of correlations between local trait-based selection and processes occurring in the larger meta-community.},

	abstract = {Abstract 1. During range expansions of phytophagous insects, secondary or novel hosts may allow colonisation of areas without primary hosts. Because plant species often differ in their relative attractiveness and suitability for insects, insect preference for, and performance on, these hosts can determine recruitment potential in the current and future expansion areas.2. This study explores the relative roles of female preference and larval performance in an important pine defoliator, Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Denis \& Schiffermüller) (Lepidoptera, Notodontidae), which colonises three Pinus species at its current range margin in the Italian Alps: P. nigra (primary host), P. sylvestris (secondary host), and P. mugo (novel host).3. Host use patterns in multiple insect populations were studied through choice and no-choice oviposition experiments in cages, field surveys of mixed stands, and laboratory and field monitoring of larval growth and mortality. It was predicted that a specific life-history trait – time limitation of short-lived females to lay a single batch of eggs – would act as a component of female performance, and lead to similar rates of host acceptance in no-choice settings.4. In the choice experiment, P. nigra was accepted the most frequently while P. sylvestris was accepted the least frequently, confirming nest density patterns in the field. Contrary to prediction, females remained discriminating in no-choice settings in spite of time limitation. In contrast, relative growth rate (RGR) and mortality of larvae did not differ significantly among the three hosts, highlighting a discrepancy between female preference and larval performance.5. Recruitment potential of T. pityocampa in future expansion into stands of P. sylvestris and P. mugo is evaluated by combining host quality, conservatism in oviposition behaviour, habitat suitability, and the opportunity for local adaptation.},

	abstract = {Assessing pollinator importance of each floral visitor to a plant species is a key to understanding plant–pollinator interaction. The present study examined visitation frequency, pollination efficiency, and pollinator importance of the full range of floral visitors to Geranium thunbergii natural population, by measuring seed-set. During 2 years of observations, the flowers were visited by at least 45 insect species belonging to four orders. Among the main 22 visitor species, 11 species belonging to three orders (Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Lepidoptera) acted as the efficient pollinators. In both years, Hymenoptera, especially bees, was the most important pollinator to G. thunbergii. Thus, the flowers could be considered as bee-pollinated. However, the most important species were not constant between years. The study also documented that the efficient pollinators have larger body sizes. The dish-shaped floral morphology, taxonomically diverse pollinators, and temporal change in the most important pollinators indicate that G. thunbergii–pollinator interaction is a rather generalized system. The results suggest that casual observations of visitation, or even precise measurement of pollinator importance in a single season is insufficient to identify important pollinators.},

Among short-scaped plants, both pollination success, quantified as initiation of fruits and seeds, and seed predation were positively correlated with the relative frequency of the long-scaped morph. The relative strength of these effects and the direction of the resulting frequency-dependent selection on scape morph varied among years and populations. The results suggest that both mutualists and antagonists may mediate frequency-dependent selection and that frequency dependence may vary from positive to negative with rare-morph advantage, depending on the relative strength of these interactions.},

In a survey of I. capensis populations, we found that vegetative herbivory and intraspecific competition were positively correlated. In a greenhouse experiment where leaf damage and plant density were manipulated, multispecies interactions had dramatic effects on reproductive and mating system traits. Despite having additive effects on growth, herbivory and competition had nonadditive effects for mating system expression, chasmogamous fruit production, flower number and size, and cleistogamous flower production. Our results demonstrate that competitive interactions influence the effect of herbivory (and vice versa) on fitness components and mating system, and thus antagonisms may have unforeseen consequences for mating system evolution, population genetic diversity, and persistence.},

In the perennial herb Arabidopsis lyrata, trichome production is a resistance trait that exhibits both qualitative and quantitative variation. Using a paternal half-sib design, we conducted two greenhouse experiments to ask whether trichomes confer resistance to oviposition and leaf herbivory by the specialist moth Plutella xylostella, and to examine potential genetic constraints on evolution of increased resistance and trichome density. In addition, we examined whether trichome production is induced by insect herbivory. We found strong positive genetic and phenotypic correlations between leaf trichome density and resistance to leaf herbivory, demonstrating that the production of leaf trichomes increases resistance to leaf damage by P. xylostella. Also resistance to oviposition tended to increase with increasing leaf trichome density, but genetic and phenotypic correlations were not statistically significant. Trichome density and resistance to leaf herbivory were negatively correlated genetically with plant size in the absence of herbivores, but not in the presence of herbivores. There was no evidence of increased trichome production after leaf damage by P. xylostella. The results suggest that trichome production and resistance to leaf herbivory are associated with a cost and that the direction of selection on resistance and trichome density depends on the intensity of herbivory.},

For the same subset of 22 Vicia species and all three aphid species, positive correlations were observed between the concentration and numbers of leaf and stem non-protein amino acids and the level of aphid resistance. Correlations were also observed between trichome density, on some organs of the host, and both nymphal survival and development time. Aphid resistance, together with these possible physical and chemical resistance mechanisms, showed a pattern which was described in relation to the taxonomy of the genus Vicia and the degree of domestication of the host.

The spatial distribution of individual plants within a population and the population’s genetic structure are determined by several factors, like dispersal, reproduction mode or biotic interactions. The role of interspecific interactions in shaping the spatial genetic structure of plant populations remains largely unknown. 2. Species with a common evolutionary history are known to interact more closely with each other than unrelated species due to the greater number of traits they share. We hypothesize that plant interactions may shape the fine genetic structure of closely related congeners. 3. We used spatial statistics (georeferenced design) and molecular techniques (ISSR markers) to understand how two closely related congeners, Thymus vulgaris (widespread species) and T. loscosii (narrow endemic) interact at the local scale. Specific cover, number of individuals of both study species and several community attributes were measured in a 10 × 10 m plot. 4. Both species showed similar levels of genetic variation, but differed in their spatial genetic structure. Thymus vulgaris showed spatial aggregation but no spatial genetic structure, while T. loscosii showed spatial genetic structure (positive genetic autocorrelation) at short distances. The spatial pattern of T. vulgaris’ cover showed significant dissociation with that of T. loscosii. The same was true between the spatial patterns of the cover of T. vulgaris and the abundance of T. loscosii and between the abundance of each species. Most importantly, we found a correlation between the genetic structure of T. loscosii and the abundance of T. vulgaris: T. loscosii plants were genetically more similar when they were surrounded by a similar number of T. vulgaris plants. 5. Synthesis. Our results reveal spatially complex genetic structures of both congeners at small spatial scales. The negative association among the spatial patterns of the two species and the genetic structure found for T. loscosii in relation to the abundance of T. vulgaris indicate that competition between the two species may account for the presence of adapted ecotypes of T. loscosii to the abundance of a competing congeneric species. This suggests that the presence and abundance of close congeners can influence the genetic spatial structure of plant species at fine scales.},

	abstract = {A simple hypothesis about habitat choice by ovipositing butterflies is that females prefer to lay their eggs on plants in habitats where juvenile growth and survival are best. This hypothesis was evaluated by studying 3 Aristolochia-feeding swallowtail butterflies (Papilionidae: Troidini). Results show that the eggs and larvae of all 3 butterfly species survive significantly better in shady habitats than in sunny habitats. Pupal survival is similar in the 2 habitats for at least 1 species. Larval growth rates were similar in the 2 habitats for all 3 species. Thus, for all 3 species shady habitats appear to be more suitable for juvenile development and survival than sunny habitats. Only Parides montezuma lays most of its eggs in shady habitats, however; Battus philenor and B. polydamus females lay most of their eggs in sunny habitats. The original hypothesis is therefore not upheld by this study. Three alternative explanations for the discrepancy between the relative suitability of habitats for the juvenile stages and habitat choice by ovipositing females are suggested.},

D. radicum was univoltine in canola. Peak emergence occurred after an accumulation of 345.8 ± 79.4 DD, and 50\% flight activity required accumulation of 324.5 ± 46.8 DD (soil base 4°C). D. platura was bivoltine in canola. Peak emergence of the first generation required 339.5 DD, and the second generation required 594.5 ± 38.9 DD (soil base 3.9°C). Peak flight activity occurred after accumulation of 255.0 ± 74.2 and 639.9 ± 69.4 DD for the first and second generations, respectively. A logistic model was used to describe the relationship of degree-days and Julian-days with emergence patterns of adult flies and predicted that 10, 50, and 95\% emergence of D. radicum required 213.7 ± 39.9, 324.5 ± 46.8, and 467.2 ± 46.3 DD, respectively. Logistic analysis predicted that 50\% emergence of the first generation of D. platura required an average of 255.0 ± 74.2 DD, and the second generation required 526.8 ± 66.6, 639.9 ± 69.4, and 952.8 ± 77.0 DD for 10, 50, and 95\% emergence, respectively. Determination of the temporal patterns of abundance of D. radicum and D. platura has potential application for pest management because it can help ensure that phenologies of candidate agents for biocontrol are synchronous with those of the pests they are targeted to control.},

In surveys of phytophagous arthropods over two years, we found the aspen canopy supports nearly 100 morphospecies. We identified significant broad-sense heritability of plant functional traits, basic plant defence chemistry, and arthropod community traits. The majority of arthropods were specialists, those coevolved with P. tremula to tolerate and even utilize leaf defence compounds. Arthropod abundance and richness were more closely related to plant growth rates than general chemical defences and relationships were identified between the arthropod community and stem growth, leaf and petiole morphology, anthocyanins, and condensed tannins. Heritable genetic variation in plant traits in young aspen was found to structure arthropod community; however no single trait drives the preferences of arthropod folivores among young aspen genotypes. The influence of natural variation in plant traits on the arthropod community indicates the importance of maintaining genetic variation in wild trees as keystone species for biodiversity. It further suggests that aspen can be a resource for the study of mechanisms of natural resistance to herbivores.},

The detailed metabolite profiling of thousands of plant samples has great potential for directly elucidating plant metabolic processes. However, both a comprehensive analysis and a high throughput are difficult to achieve at the same time due to the wide diversity of metabolites in plants. Here, we have established a novel and practical metabolomics methodology for quantifying hundreds of targeted metabolites in a high-throughput manner. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (TQMS), which monitors both the specific precursor ions and product ions of each metabolite, is a standard technique in targeted metabolomics, as it enables high sensitivity, reproducibility and a broad dynamic range. In this study, we optimized the MRM conditions for specific compounds by performing automated flow injection analyses with TQMS. Based on a total of 61,920 spectra for 860 authentic compounds, the MRM conditions of 497 compounds were successfully optimized. These were applied to high-throughput automated analysis of biological samples using TQMS coupled with ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). By this analysis, approximately 100 metabolites were quantified in each of 14 plant accessions from Brassicaceae, Gramineae and Fabaceae. A hierarchical cluster analysis based on the metabolite accumulation patterns clearly showed differences among the plant families, and family-specific metabolites could be predicted using a batch-learning self-organizing map analysis. Thus, the automated widely targeted metabolomics approach established here should pave the way for large-scale metabolite profiling and comparative metabolomics.},

Using likelihood-based methods coupled with Monte Carlo simulations, it is now possible to reconstruct past changes in population size from genetic data. Using simulated data sets under various demographic scenarios, we evaluate the statistical performance of Msvar, a full-likelihood Bayesian method that infers past demographic change from microsatellite data. Our simulation tests show that Msvar is very efficient at detecting population declines and expansions, provided the event is neither too weak nor too recent. We further show that Msvar outperforms two moment-based methods (the M-ratio test and Bottleneck) for detecting population size changes, whatever the time and the severity of the event. The same trend emerges from a compilation of empirical studies. The latest version of Msvar provides estimates of the current and the ancestral population size and the time since the population started changing in size. We show that, in the absence of prior knowledge, Msvar provides little information on the mutation rate, which results in biased estimates and/or wide credibility intervals for each of the demographic parameters. However, scaling the population size parameters with the mutation rate and scaling the time with current population size, as coalescent theory requires, significantly improves the quality of the estimates for contraction but not for expansion scenarios. Finally, our results suggest that Msvar is robust to moderate departures from a strict stepwise mutation model.},

	abstract = {Plant–pollinator interactions are one of the most important and variable mutualisms in nature. Multiple pollinators often visit plants and can vary in visitation rates, pollen removal and deposition, and spatial and temporal distribution, altering plant reproduction and patterns of pollinator-mediated selection. Although some visitors may not be effective pollinators, pollinator effectiveness is rarely estimated directly as seed set resulting from a single visit by each taxon visiting generalist plants. For two years, effectiveness of visitors to wild radish, Raphanus raphanistrum, was quantified by counting seeds set and pollen grains removed as a result of a single visit. We calculated a pollinator's importance to plant reproduction as the product of visitation rate and single-visit seed set, and regressed pollinator body size on pollen-removal and on seed set effectiveness. Although pollinators differed in effectiveness and visitation rates, pollinator importance was primarily determined by visitation rates. In contrast to similar 2-yr studies, pollinator assemblage composition varied little, suggesting pollinator-mediated selection can be consistent across years for this generalist. Larger pollinators were more effective than smaller at effecting seed set, but body size was a poor predictor of pollen removal ability. Instead, pollen-removal effectiveness may be more influenced by foraging behavior than size.},

To address this need, we provided the neo-tropical milkweed, Asclepias curassavica, with two levels of nitrogen availability and examined how altered host-plant quality influenced the responses of a specialist aphid, Aphis nerii, and a coccinellid predator, Harmonia axyridis. Aphis nerii uses A. curassavica for multiple resources, including nutrition and sequestration of cardenolides for defense against natural enemies. Increased nitrogen availability improved A. curassavica quality by decreasing carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratios and cardenolide concentrations, resulting in A. nerii that also had lower C:N ratios and cardenolide concentrations. Aphis nerii population growth was higher on plants with high nitrogen availability, compared with aphids on plants with low nitrogen availability. In no-choice feeding trials, Harmonia axyridis consumed more high C:N ratio aphids, suggesting a potential compensatory response to reduced aphid nutritional quality. Additionally, H. axyridis were able to consume more low-quality aphids at the expense of increasing exposure to increased cardenolide concentrations, suggesting that interactions between H. axyridis and A. nerii may be strongly influenced by prey nutritional quality. This work highlights the need to consider how variation in plant quality influences herbivore nutritional and defensive quality when examining mechanisms that influence predator–prey interactions.},

	abstract = {A plant's best strategy for acquiring resources may often depend on the identity of neighbours. Here, I ask whether plants adjust their strategy to local relatedness: individuals may cooperate (reduce competitiveness) with kin but compete relatively intensely with non-kin. In a greenhouse experiment with Ipomoea hederacea, neighbouring siblings from the same inbred line were relatively uniform in height; groups of mixed lines, however, were increasingly variable as their mean height increased. The reproductive yield of mixed and sibling groups was similar overall, but when adjusted to a common mean height and height inequality, the yield of mixed groups was significantly less. Where this difference in yield was most pronounced (among groups that varied most in height), mixed groups tended to allocate more mass to roots than comparable sibling groups, and overall, mixed groups produced significantly fewer seeds per unit mass of roots. These results suggest that, from the group perspective, non-kin may have wasted resources in below-ground competition at the expense of reproduction; kin groups, on the other hand, displayed the relative efficiency that is expected of reduced competitiveness.},

Diffuse coevolution, by contrast, has received much less empirical attention, presumably because imprecise definitions of diffuse coevolution have hindered the development of experimental approaches for distinguishing between pairwise and diffuse coevolution. Here we provide a definition of diffuse coevolution that leads to three criteria for the operation of pairwise coevolution: susceptibilities (resistances) to different herbivores are genetically uncorrelated, the presence/absence of one herbivore does not affect the amount of damage caused by other herbivores, and the impact of one herbivore on plant fitness does not depend on the presence/absence of other herbivores. All three criteria must be satisfied for coevolution to be pairwise; if any of them fail, coevolution is diffuse. We then describe an experimental design and statistical analysis that permit the partitioning of the total selection imposed on a plant by a set of herbivores into components representing pairwise and diffuse selection, thus allowing determination of whether coevolution is pairwise or diffuse.},

We investigated to what extent selection along an altitudinal gradient or genetic drift contributed to variation in ecologically relevant traits in Arabidopsis thaliana. We collected seeds from 8 to 14 individuals from each of 14 A. thaliana populations originating from sites between 800 and 2700 m above sea level in the Swiss Alps. Seed families were grown with and without vernalization, corresponding to winter-annual and summer-annual life histories, respectively. We analyzed putatively neutral genetic divergence between these populations using 24 simple sequence repeat markers. We measured seven traits related to growth, phenology and leaf morphology that are rarely reported in A. thaliana and performed analyses of altitudinal clines, as well as overall QST-FST comparisons and correlation analyses among pair-wise QST, FST and altitude of origin differences. Multivariate analyses suggested adaptive differentiation along altitude in the entire suite of traits, particularly when expressed in the summer-annual life history. Of the individual traits, a decrease in rosette leaf number in the vegetative state and an increase in leaf succulence with increasing altitude could be attributed to adaptive divergence. Interestingly, these patterns relate well to common within- and between-species trends of smaller plant size and thicker leaves at high altitude. Our results thus offer exciting possibilities to unravel the underlying mechanisms for these conspicuous trends using the model species A. thaliana.},

Herbivory may enhance plant diversity in two qualitatively different ways. The first is global frequency dependence; the level of herbivory suffered by a plant decreases as the species becomes rare. Second, spatial variability in levels of herbivory can create ephemeral, local refuges for herbivory for each plant species. Both of these mechanisms operate only if there is not a negative correlation between a plant's palatability and its competitive ability. Both mechanisms also require that herbivores have sufficiently strong diet preferences (or, equivalently, that the plants have sufficiently different grazing tolerances). If there is no relationship between palatability and competitive ability, then plant diversity is a monotonically increasing function of the herbivore's degree of monophagy. In contrast, if there is a positive correlation between palatability and competitive ability, then the diversity/degree-of-monophagy relationship may be either monotonically increasing or humped.},

If the number of pollinator visits is independent of the flowering strategy, then it is quite immaterial how many flowers are presented at the same time in a self-compatible (SC) species, whereas presenting flowers one at a time is optimal in a self-incompatible (SI) species. Depending on the values of other parameters, mass blooming can be an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) if plants that practice it attract more pollinators. Selection for mass blooming is more likely to occur in SC species than in SI species, if pollinators are scarce and if pollen transfer rates are low. 3.

	abstract = {Background and Aims Cultivated flax (Linum usitatissimum) is known to have undergone a whole-genome duplication around 5–9 million years ago. The aim of this study was to investigate whether other whole-genome duplication events have occurred in the evolutionary history of cultivated flax. Knowledge of such whole-genome duplications will be important in understanding the biology and genomics of cultivated flax. Methods Transcriptomes of 11 Linum species were sequenced using the Illumina platform. The short reads were assembled de novo and the DupPipe pipeline was used to look for signatures of polyploidy events from the age distribution of paralogues. In addition, phylogenies of all paralogues were assembled within an estimated age window of interest. These phylogenies were assessed for evidence of a paleopolyploidy event within the genus Linum. Key Results A previously unknown paleopolyploidy event that occurred 20–40 million years ago was discovered and shown to be specific to a clade within Linum containing cultivated flax (L. usitatissimum) and other mainly blue-flowered species. The finding was supported by two lines of evidence. First, a significant change of slope (peak) was shown in the age distribution of paralogues that was phylogenetically restricted to, and ubiquitous in, this clade. Second, a large number of paralogue phylogenies were retrieved that are consistent with a polyploidy event occurring within that clade. Conclusions The results show the utility of multi-species transcriptomics for detecting whole-genome duplication events and demonstrate that that multiple rounds of polyploidy have been important in shaping the evolutionary history of flax. Understanding and characterizing these whole-genome duplication events will be important for future Linum research.},

	abstract = {An improvement in plant production is increasingly important for a sustainable human society. For this purpose, understanding the mechanism of plant production, that is, the plant metabolic system, is an immediate necessity. After the sequencing of the Arabidopsis genome, it has become possible to obtain a bird’s eye view of its metabolism by means of omics such as transcriptomics and proteomics. Availability of thousands of transcriptome data points in the public domain has resulted in great advances in the methodology of functional genomics. Metabolome data can be a “gold mine” of biological findings. However, as the total throughput of metabolomics is far lower than that of transcriptomics due to technical difficulties, there is currently no publicly available large-scale metabolome dataset that is comparable in size to the transcriptome dataset. Recently, we established a novel methodology, termed widely targeted metabolomics, which can generate thousands of metabolome data points in a high-throughput manner. We previously conducted a targeted metabolite analysis of large-scale Arabidopsis bioresources, namely transposon-tagged mutants and accessions, to make a smaller dataset of metabolite accumulation. In this paper, we release approximately 3,000 metabolic profiles obtained by targeted analysis for 36 metabolites and discuss the possible regulation of amino acid accumulation.},

Analysis of dwarfs or giants within a certain taxon is a promising tool for a functional understanding of size control. Bonsai cultivation techniques lead to the most extreme forms of environmentally induced plant dwarfism. It is shown that no such changes take place at the level of cell size of leaves. Leaves of four out of six species of Bonsai had even bigger cells than leaves of normal trees, which is similar to what was observed in genetically dwarf plants from high altitudes. These results illustrate the insignificance of intraspecific cell size variations for explanations of differences of size and growth of plants. Genetic control of cell size is stronger than the most severe environmental impact as it is received by Bonsais. The relevance of concepts developed for the control of cell size and cell division in unicellular organisms for meristematic plants is discussed.{\textbackslash}textless/P{\textbackslash}textgreater},

	abstract = {Physiological and morphological differences between Plantago major L. (Plantaginaceae) growing in full sunlight and shaded conditions were examined. Photosynthesis of isolated leaves was saturated by irradiance around 300 μE m-2 sec-1 and 170 μE m-2 sec-1, respectively. In contrast to previous studies of sun/shade leaf responses, initial slopes of curves from shaded plants are significantly less than those taken from full-sun plants. Within the 400-500 nm and 600-700 nm ranges, leaves 5.0 cm or longer are essentially opaque, transmitting less than 1.25\% of incident light. Chlorophyll content per unit leaf area is nearly equivalent for leaves from plants growing under the two extremes in light levels. Morphometric comparisons indicate shaded plants bear fewer leaves, have less leaf overlap, lower total leaf area, and longer petioles than full-sun plants. Leaf elongation rates are lower and the duration between the emergence of successive leaves is longer in shaded plants. Computer analyses of both types of rosette morphology reveal shaded plants have an equal or greater capacity to intercept light than full-sun plants, principally because of the minimization of leaf overlap and the large variation in the deflection angles of leaves in shaded rosette morphologies. Simulations, calculated on the basis of light interception, and taking into account the transition between photosynthate-importing and -exporting leaves, predict relative growth rates for full-sun and shaded rosette morphologies that are in reasonable agreement with empirically determined leaf growth rates. However, the data indicate that significant physiological and morphological differences exist among leaves from a single rosette, and among developmentally comparable leaves from rosettes growing under different ambient light environments. Differences among leaves on a single plant must be accommodated in computerized techniques attempting to simulate light interception and its consequences on potential growth rates.},

	abstract = {It has been proposed that seaweed secondary metabolites, e.g. brown algal phlorotannins, may have an ecologically important function as a chemical defence against epiphytes, by acting against colonisation of epiphytic organisms. We tested whether the low epiphytic abundance on the invasive brown seaweed Fucus evanescens, compared to the congeneric F. vesiculosus, is due to a more effective chemical defence against epiphyte colonisation. A field survey of the distribution of the common fouling organism Balanus improvisus (Cirripedia) showed that the abundance was consistently lower on F. evanescens than on F. vesiculosus. However, contrary to expectations, results from experimental studies indicated that F. vesiculosus has a more effective anti-settlement defence than F. evanescens. In settlement experiments with intact fronds of the two Fucus species, both species deterred settlement by barnacle larvae, but settlement was lower on F. vesiculosus both in choice and no-choice experiments. Phlorotannins from F. vesiculosus also had a stronger negative effect on larval settlement and were active at a lower concentration than those from F. evanescens. The results show that Fucus phlorotannins have the potential to inhibit settlement of invertebrate larvae, but that settlement inhibition cannot explain the lower abundance of the barnacle Balanus improvisus on F. evanescens compared to F. vesiculosus. Assessment of barnacle survival in the laboratory and in the field showed that this pattern could instead be attributed to a higher mortality of newly settled barnacles. Observation suggests that the increased mortality was due to detachment of young barnacles from the seaweed surface. This shows that the antifouling mechanism of F. evanescens acts on post-settlement stages of B. improvisus.},

	abstract = {Host-associated differentiation (HAD) is the formation of genetically distinct host-associated populations. One of the genotypic signatures of HAD is that populations exhibit stronger differentiation by host-plant species than by geographic isolation. HAD, as a mechanism promoting ecological speciation, has been invoked to explain phytophagous insect diversity. Two traits proposed to promote HAD are endophagy and parthenogenesis. Using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), we tested for the presence of HAD in pecan leaf phylloxera, Phylloxera notabilis Pergande (Hemiptera: Phylloxeridae), an endophagous, gall inducing, and cyclically parthenogenetic insect on sympatric pecan and water hickory at a geographic mesoscale. This species shows strong HAD. Whereas the effect of collecting site was significant, accounting for 7.3\% of molecular variation, host-plant species identity accounted for 63.5\%. In addition, a choice test indicated that pecan leaf phylloxera originating from water hickory showed weak but significant preference for leaflets of the natal host, whereas pecan leaf phylloxera originating from pecan did not. This is the first such study of a species of arboreal Phylloxeridae, a poorly known insect group. This is also the first endophage and the second parthenogen shared by these two hickory species to show evidence of HAD. This hickory system could be a good parthenogen-rich counterpoint to the goldenrod system in the study of HAD in insect communities.},

I combine field studies and genetic analysis to (1) examine the function of trichomes as a resistance character in natural populations, (2) compare the magnitude of population differentiation in trichome-production and at putatively neutral marker loci, (3) examine the molecular genetic basis of trichome-production, and (4) quantify the effects of herbivore removal on population growth and relative performance of glabrous and trichome-producing plants.In a survey of 30 populations of A. lyrata in Norway and Sweden, I documented spatiotemporal variation in damage from insect herbivores. With few exceptions, glabrous plants were more damaged by herbivorous insects than trichome-producing plants in polymorphic populations. Damage levels varied substantially among populations and among years. The intensity of herbivory quantified as mean leaf removal to glabrous plants was higher in polymorphic populations than in monomorphic glabrous populations.Within the Swedish range, populations were more strongly differentiated at the locus coding for glabrousness than at eight putatively neutral isozyme loci. This is consistent with the hypothesis that trichome production is subject to divergent selection.A study of the genetic basis of trichome production showed that glabrousness was associated with mutations in an orthologue to GLABROUS1, a regulatory gene known to cause glabrousness in A. thaliana. Comparative data indicate that the genetic basis of glabrousness varies among populations.Experimental removal of insect herbivores in a natural A. lyrata population increased population growth rate and the relative fitness of the glabrous morph. The results suggest that insect herbivory may influence both population dynamics and selection on trichome production in A. lyrata.},

The research presented here reports the influence of elm leaf chemistry on the feeding activity of two generalist herbivores, the Japanese beetle and gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae). Elm leaf chemistry was surveyed for 19 species, 5 cultivars, and 2 varieties that are known to vary in susceptibility to Japanese beetle feeding damage. Extracts were analyzed for significant differences in lipid, phenolic, terpene, and alkaloid diversity; those data were then compared with previous findings in Japanese beetle laboratory and field studies, and a gypsy moth no-choice developmental study. Elms that belong to the U. davidiana complex were more suitable for gypsy moth development compared with other elms tested. These elms typically had greater levels of lipid and overall blend complexity in the leaf chemical extracts. Elm leaf lipid extractions were evaluated for deterrent effects on Japanese beetle feeding activity in a greenhouse study and only three (U. propinqua var suberosa, 'Commendation' and U. wilsoniana) deterred Japanese beetle feeding. Elm tree susceptibility to gypsy moth and Japanese beetle injury was correlated with the leaf chemistry surveyed in this study; more specifically elm leaf lipids influenced Japanese beetle and gypsy moth preference for the Asian elms tested.},

	abstract = {We studied the relationship between inflorescence size and male fitness in the andromonoecious lily Zigadenus paniculatus, using experimentally manipulated inflorescences to eliminate possible correlations between flower number, resource availability, and other floral traits. Allozyme markers were used to determine the siring success of large versus small plants in 14 arrays of plants, each array containing five large and five small plants. The inflorescence size of small plants was held constant both within and among arrays; the size of large plants was held constant within an array but was varied among arrays. Large plants sired more than half the seeds in 12 of the 14 arrays, and significantly more than half in six of these 12. However, in eight of the arrays, large plants sired significantly fewer seeds than expected on the basis of their size advantage. Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between relative size and relative siring success in comparisons among arrays. A maximum-likelihood model estimated that 28\% of seeds were sired by imported pollen, with 95\% confidence limits of 13\% and 50\%. Within these limits, high import rates tended to mask the relative success of large plants in several arrays. These results suggest that the evolution of inflorescence size in Z. paniculatus is at least partly driven by selection for increased male success, assuming genetic variation for flower number. However, the data also support a growing body of evidence that estimates of male fitness in plants can be highly variable. We discuss the sources of this variability and the possible effects of inflorescence design on the relationship between inflorescence size and fitness.},

	abstract = {The logistic model is a fundamental population model often used as the basis for analyzing wildlife population dynamics. In the classic logistic model, however, population dynamics may be difficult to characterize if habitat size is temporally variable because population density can vary at a constant abundance, which results in variable strength of density-dependent feedback for a given population size. To incorporate habitat size variability, we developed a general population model in which changes in population abundance, density, and habitat size are taken into account. From this model, we deduced several predictions for patterns and processes of population dynamics: 1) patterns of fluctuation in population abundance and density can diverge, with respect of their correlation and relative variability; and 2) along with density dependence, habitat size fluctuation can affect population growth with a time lag because changes in habitat size result in changes in population density. In order to test these predictions, we applied our model to population dynamics data of 36 populations of Tigriopus japonicus, a marine copepod inhabiting tide pools of variable sizes caused by weather processes. As expected, we found a significant difference in the fluctuation patterns of population abundance and density of T. japonicus populations with respect to the correlation between abundance and density and their relative variability, which correlates positively with the variability of habitat size. In addition, we found direct and lagged-indirect effects of weather processes on population growth, which were associated with density dependence and impose regulatory forces on local and regional population dynamics. These results illustrate how changes in habitat size can have an impact on patterns and processes of wildlife population dynamics. We suggest that without knowledge of habitat size fluctuation, measures of population size and its variability as well as inferences about the processes of population dynamics may be misleading.},

	abstract = {A correct timing of growth cessation and dormancy induction represents a critical ecological and evolutionary trade-off between survival and growth in most forest trees (Rehfeldt et al. 1999; Horvath et al. 2003; Howe et al. 2003). We have studied the deciduous tree European Aspen (Populus tremula) across a latitudinal gradient and compared genetic differentiation in phenology traits with molecular markers. Trees from 12 different areas covering 10 latitudinal degrees were cloned and planted in two common gardens. Several phenology traits showed strong genetic differentiation and clinal variation across the latitudinal gradient, with QST values generally exceeding 0.5. This is in stark contrast to genetic differentiation at several classes of genetic markers (18 neutral SSRs, 7 SSRs located close to phenology candidate genes and 50 SNPs from five phenology candidate genes) that all showed FST values around 0.015. We thus find strong evidence for adaptive divergence in phenology traits across the latitudinal gradient. However, the strong population structure seen at the quantitative traits is not reflected in underlying candidate genes. This result fit theoretical expectations that suggest that genetic differentiation at candidate loci is better described by FST at neutral loci rather than by QST at the quantitative traits themselves.},

	abstract = {* 1Competition plays an important role in structuring populations and communities, but our understanding of the genetic basis of competitive ability is poor. This is further complicated by the fact that plants can express both competitive effect (target plant influence upon neighbour growth) and competitive response (target plant growth as a function of a neighbour) abilities, with these ecological characteristics potentially being independent. * 2Using the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana, we investigated patterns of intraspecific variation in competitive effect and response abilities and their relationships to other plant traits and resource supply rates. * 3Both competitive effect and response were measured for 11 genotypes, including the Columbia ecotype and 10 derived mutant genotypes. Plants were grown alone, with intragenotypic competition, and with intergenotypic competition in a replicated blocked design with high nutrient and low nutrient soil nutrient treatments. We quantified competitive effect and response on absolute and per-gram bases. * 4Competitive effect and response varied among genotypes, with the relative competitive abilities of genotypes consistent across fertilization treatments. Overall, high rates of fertilization increased competitive effect and competitive response abilities of all genotypes. Both competitive effect and response were correlated with neighbour biomass, though genotype-specific traits also influenced competitive response. * 5At the genotype level, there was no correlation between competitive effect and response in either fertilization treatment. Overall patterns in competitive response appeared consistent among inter- and intragenotypic competition treatments, indicating that a target genotype's response to competition was not driven by the genetic identity of the competitor. * 6These findings indicate that within A. thaliana, there is the potential for differential selection on competitive effect and response abilities, and that such selection may influence different sets of plant traits. The concept of a single competitive ability for a given plant is not supported by these data, and we suggest continued recognition of these dual competitive abilities is essential to understanding the potential role of competition in influencing intra- and interspecific processes.},

Multi-state mark–recapture models with dead recoveries were used to estimate survival and transition probabilities for over 2,300 individuals in 12 populations of P. ionantha . These estimates were applied to parameterize matrix models used in further analyses. P. ionantha demographics were found to be strongly dependent on prescribed fire events. Periodic matrix models were used to evaluate season of burn (either growing or dormant season) for fire return intervals ranging from 1 to 20 years. Annual growing and biannual dormant season fires maximized population growth rates for this species. A regression design LTRE was used to evaluate the effect of number of days since last fire on population growth. Maximum population growth rates calculated using standard asymptotic analysis were realized shortly following a burn event (\&lt;2 years), and a regression design LTRE showed that short-term fire-mediated changes in vital rates translated into observed increases in population growth. The LTRE identified fecundity and individual growth as contributing most to increases in post-fire population growth. Our analyses found that the current four-year prescribed fire return intervals used at the study sites can be significantly shortened to increase the population growth rates of this rare species. Understanding the role of fire frequency and season in creating and maintaining appropriate habitat for this species may aid in the conservation of this and other rare herb bog/savanna inhabitants.},

The geographical pattern of the cpDNA variations was highly structured in each species, and the following three regional populations were genetically highly differentiated among all four species: (1) the Sea of Japan-side area, (2) the Kanto region, and (3) southwestern Japan. Based on some interspecific similarities among the phylogeographic patterns, the following migration scenario of Japanese deciduous broad-leaved forests was postulated. During the last glacial maximum (LGM), the forests were separately distributed in six regions. After LGM, as the climate warmed, the forests in eastern Japan separately expanded from each of the refugia along the Sea of Japan-side or along the Pacific Ocean-side. In contrast, those in southwestern Japan retreated and moved to high altitudes from each of the continuous forests.},

	abstract = {To understand the consequences of human accelerated environmental change, it is important to document the effects on natural populations of an increasing frequency of extreme climatic events. In stream ecosystems, recent climate change has resulted in extreme variation in both thermal and hydrological regimes. From 2001 to 2004, a severe drought in western United States corresponded with earlier emergence of the adult stage of the high-altitude stream mayfly, Baetis bicaudatus. Using a long-term database from a western Colorado stream, the peak emergence date of this mayfly population was predicted by both the magnitude and date of peak stream flow, and by the mean daily water temperature, suggesting that Baetis may respond to declining stream flow or increasing water temperature as proximate cues for early metamorphosis. However, in a one-year survey of multiple streams from the same drainage basin, only water temperature predicted spatial variation in the onset of emergence of this mayfly. To decouple the effects of temperature and flow, we separately manipulated these factors in flow-through microcosms and measured the timing of B. bicaudatus metamorphosis to the adult stage. Mayflies emerged sooner in a warmed-water treatment than an ambient-water treatment; but reducing flow did not accelerate the onset of mayfly emergence. Nonetheless, using warming temperatures to cue metamorphosis enables mayflies to time their emergence during the descending limb of the hydrograph when oviposition sites (protruding rocks) are becoming available. We speculate that large-scale climate changes involving warming and stream drying could cause significant shifts in the timing of mayfly metamorphosis, thereby having negative effects on populations that play an important role in stream ecosystems.},

As the plants are self-incompatible, separation of sex functions between flowers may function to avoid sexual interference rather than to avoid inbreeding depression.

Simultaneous self- and cross-pollination also reduced fruit production. Overall, self-pollen on a stigma reduced seed production by 85\% compared with cross-pollination. * 3Growth rate of self-pollen tubes in carpels did not differ from that of cross-pollen tubes, and self-pollen tubes could reach ovules. This indicates that A. quinata has late-acting self-incompatibility, which may cause sexual interference if self-pollination occurs. * 4These results support the idea that monoecy in A. quinata functions to avoid sexual interference, which imposes a fitness cost, at least on female function.},

	abstract = {Collards were grown at Ithaca, New York, in two experimental habitats: pure stands and single rows that were bounded on each side by diverse, meadow vegetation. The arthropods associated with these plants were sampled on 20 dates over a 3—year period. The status of the herbivore species was measured by their rank in biomass in each sample. The two most prominent species, Phyllotreta cruciferae and Pieris rapae, maintained high status throughout the investigation, but another important species, Brevicoryne brassicae, was absent for an entire season. Pit feeders usually formed the most important herbivore guild. Nevertheless, the guild spectrum, which describes the functional structure of the fauna, varied widely in time and space. The size distributions of species and of individuals were both highly skewed toward the smaller sizes. Herbivore loads, the mean biomass of herbivores per 100 g of consumable foliage, were consistently higher in the pure stands. Moreover, herbivore loads varied significantly with season in each experimental habitat. Both the number of herbivore species and the diversity of the herbivore load were greater in the diverse habitat. Biomass was more heavily concentrated among the prominent herbivores in the pure stands; increased dominance, rather than differences in species richness, appeared to be the major cause for the lower herbivore diversity in this habitat. The diversity of predators and parasitoids was higher in the pure stands. Most of the abundant species found on collards shared a similar narrow range of hosts. As a result the species in this core group of herbivores and parasitoids were regularly associated with each other. Predators and the less abundant herbivores tended to be less specialized and served to link the collard association with the surrounding community. Plant—arthropod associations are representative of component communities, well—integrated systems that form portions of larger compound communities. This distinction facilitates the analysis of community structure. Microclimates and the effectiveness of "enemies" did not appear to differ sufficiently in the two experimental habitats to account for the observed differences in the herbivore load. The results suggest a new proposition, the resource concentration hypothesis, which states that herbivores are more likely to find and remain on hosts that are growing in dense or nearly pure stands; that the most specialized species frequently attain higher relative densities in simple environments; and that, as a result, biomass tends to become concentrated in a few species, causing a decrease in the diversity of herbivores in pure stands.

	abstract = {Juvenile and adult marine organisms differ in their morphology, chemistry, physiology, behavior, and ecology. Because juvenile algae are thinner, smaller, and have more delicate tissues than adults, they are often assumed to be more susceptible to grazers. We examined within-species food preferences of four common generalist herbivores for juvenile and adult tissues of eight common brown algae in two-choice laboratory food-preference experiments. Our results showed that juvenile algae did not tend to be a preferred food of herbivores. Juvenile tissues were significantly preferred over adult tissues in only four of the 32 combinations of algae and herbivores tested. In 12 experiments, adult tissues were preferred over juvenile tissues, and no choice occurred in the remaining 16 experiments. When sea urchins exhibited a preference, it was always for adult tissues. The other three herbivores, an isopod and two snails, were more variable in their choices, sometimes preferring juveniles, sometimes adults, and sometimes having no preference. We measured nitrogen and phlorotannin concentrations in adult and juvenile seaweeds to see whether these parameters were correlated with herbivore food preferences. Nitrogen levels were similar in juveniles and adults of three algal species and were higher in juveniles of two. Phlorotannin levels were higher in juveniles of four species and lower in juveniles of one. The other three species showed no differences in phlorotannin levels. Phlorotannin concentrations decreased with increasing juvenile size in three species and increased with increasing size in one species. Neither nitrogen nor phlorotannin concentrations explained overall herbivore food preferences for algae of different stages. Our results suggest that preferences of certain grazers for juvenile algae are not as strong as previously assumed and are dependent on herbivore species. Preferences between juveniles and adults are likely to be determined by a combination of morphological and chemical features of the tissues and the unique responses of herbivore species to those features.},

Only M. appendiculata laid eggs on this plant, as well as on Potamogeton, where M. mutica exclusively oviposited.

Our study demonstrates that the establishment of mixed forests per se is not sufficient to convey associational resistance to herbivores if the identity of tree species associated in mixtures is not taken into account. As a general rule, mixing phylogenetically more distinct tree species, such as mixtures of conifers and broadleaved trees, results in more effective reduction in herbivore damage.},

Many important systems in ecology and biology, however, are difficult to capture with statistical models. Stochastic simulation models offer an alternative, but they were hitherto associated with a major disadvantage: their likelihood functions can usually not be calculated explicitly, and thus it is difficult to couple them to well-established statistical theory such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. A number of new methods, among them Approximate Bayesian Computing and Pattern-Oriented Modelling, bypass this limitation. These methods share three main principles: aggregation of simulated and observed data via summary statistics, likelihood approximation based on the summary statistics, and efficient sampling. We discuss principles as well as advantages and caveats of these methods, and demonstrate their potential for integrating stochastic simulation models into a unified framework for statistical modelling.},

However, little is known about whether the temporal changes in herbivorous impact work as a selective agent for defensive traits of invaded plants. Solidago altissima (goldenrod) is a North American perennial that has widely invaded abandoned fields in Japan. Recently, an herbivorous insect Corythucha marmorata (lace bug), an exotic insect also from North America, which was first recorded in 2000 in Japan, has been expanding its habitat on S. altissima populations in Japan. In this study, we investigated whether the invasion of C. marmorata had a selective impact on the defensive traits of S. altissima, by conducting a field survey, a common garden experiment and microsatellite analysis. We compared quantitative genetic differentiation of traits (resistance, growth, and reproduction) and neutral molecular differentiation among 16 S. altissima populations with different establishment years of C. marmorata. The common garden experiment, in which plants were grown in a greenhouse and treated to either C. marmorata herbivory or no herbivory, revealed the presence of higher resistance, sexual reproduction, and asexual (rhizome) reproduction in populations subjected to a longer history of C. marmorata pressure. Such phenotypic variability among establishment years of lace bugs was likely driven by natural selection rather than stochastic events such as genetic drift and founder effects. In addition, when plants were exposed to lace bug herbivory, resistance had a positive relationship with sexual and asexual reproduction, although no relationship was found when plants were free from herbivory. These findings suggest that defensive traits in S. altissima have evolved locally in the last decade in response to the selective pressure of C. marmorata.},

	abstract = {For fruit flies, fully ripe fruit is preferred for adult oviposition and is superior for offspring performance over unripe or ripening fruit. Because not all parts of a single fruit ripen simultaneously, the opportunity exists for adult fruit flies to selectively choose riper parts of a fruit for oviposition and such selection, if it occurs, could positively influence offspring performance. Such fine scale host variation is rarely considered in fruit fly ecology, however, especially for polyphagous species which are, by definition, considered to be generalist host users. Here we study the adult oviposition preference/larval performance relationship of the Oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) (Diptera: Tephritidae), a highly polyphagous pest species, at the “within-fruit” level to see if such a host use pattern occurs. We recorded the number of oviposition attempts that female flies made into three fruit portions (top, middle and bottom), and larval behavior and development within different fruit portions for ripening (color change) and fully-ripe mango, Mangifera indica L. (Anacardiaceae). Results indicate that female B. dorsalis do not oviposit uniformly across a mango fruit, but lay most often in the top (i.e., stalk end) of fruit and least in the bottom portion, regardless of ripening stage. There was no evidence of larval feeding site preference or performance (development time, pupal weight, percent pupation) being influenced by fruit portion, within or across the fruit ripening stages. There was, however, a very significant effect on adult emergence rate from pupae, with adult emergence rate from pupae from the bottom of ripening mango being approximately only 50\% of the adult emergence rate from the top of ripening fruit, or from both the top and bottom of fully-ripe fruit. Differences in mechanical (firmness) and chemical (total soluble solids, titratable acidity, total non-structural carbohydrates) traits between different fruit portions were correlated with adult fruit utilisation. Our results support a positive adult preference/offspring performance relationship at within-fruit level for B. dorsalis. The fine level of host discrimination exhibited by B. dorsalis is at odds with the general perception that, as a polyphagous herbivore, the fly should show very little discrimination in its host use behavior.},

We have analyzed data from 42 published studies, supplemented with some unpublished data, to show the determinants of lotic periphyton δ13C. At large spatial scales, we observed broad differences in periphyton δ13C among biomes and consistent longitudinal variation related to watershed area. Longitudinal increases in δ13C indicate the importance of in-stream processes on lotic carbon cycles and autotroph δ13C variation. At local spatial scales, periphyton δ13C was negatively related to canopy cover and water current velocity and positively related to chlorophyll a density. Autotroph δ13C varied among taxonomic groups. Cyanobacteria and red algae had significantly higher and lower δ13C than other taxa, respectively. A hierarchical model across spatial scales showed that local controls for periphyton δ13C were nested by regional controls, which suggested that productivity and CO2 availability determine δ13C. Overall, our results reveal general patterns of periphyton δ13C and provide improved information for study design and the use of δ13C in isotopic mixing models in lotic food web studies.},

In the present study, concentrations of foliar sideroxylonal, an important and highly heritable defense chemical of Eucalyptus melliodora, displayed strong, fine-scale spatial autocorrelation. The spatial patterns observed could promote associational effects on herbivore foraging decisions, which may influence the selection pressures exerted on sideroxylonal content. Multiple chemical traits have roles in certain eucalypt–herbivore interactions, and the spatial characteristics of the herbivore foraging environment are therefore determined by these different factors. We used a model of E. melliodora intake by common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), based on the combined effects of two chemical traits, to explore this idea and found that the spatial patterns were different to those of sideroxylonal alone. Spatial genetic autocorrelation, examined using microsatellites, was strong and occurred at a fine scale, implying that restricted gene flow might allow genetic patches to respond to selection relatively independently. Local two-dimensional genetic autocorrelation, explored using a new heuristic method, was highly congruent with the pattern of local phenotypic variation observed for sideroxylonal, suggesting that the genetic variance underlying the sideroxylonal variation is similarly structured. Our results suggest that the spatial distribution of genetic and phenotypic variation could influence both the selective pressure imposed by herbivores on eucalypt defenses and the potential of populations to respond to natural selection. Spatial context should be considered in future studies of plant–herbivore interactions.},

	abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms that maintain genetic diversity within a population remains a primary challenge for evolutionary biology. Of the processes capable of maintaining variation, negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS), under which rare phenotypes (or alleles) enjoy a high fitness advantage, is suggested to be the most powerful. However, few experimental studies have confirmed that this process operates in nature. Although a lot of suggestive evidence has separately been provided in various polymorphic systems, these are not enough to prove the existence of NFDS in each system. Here we present a general review of NFDS and point out some problems with previous works to develop reasonable alternative research strategies for testing NFDS. In the second half of this paper, we focused on NFDS in the common bluetail damselfly, Ischnura senegalensis, that shows female-limited genetic polymorphism. We show (1) the proximate causal mechanisms of the frequency-dependent process, (2) frequency-dependent inter-morph interaction, (3) rare morph advantage and (4) morph frequency oscillations in a natural population. These results provide unequivocal empirical support for NFDS in a natural system.},

Molecular markers are proving of great value in describing the former, and it is important to similarly determine the latter in order to understand their respective contributions. The study of palaeo-climates has also advanced significantly, and in particular that of the Pleistocene ice ages, which modified species ranges considerably. The last ice age and rapid post-glacial colonization of Europe is summarized. Possible population genetic consequences of expansion northward from southern refugia, and those of remaining in these mountainous regions are discussed. A series of recent case studies are detailed where DNA sequence information has been used to describe species genetic variation and subdivision across Europe. These include a grasshopper, the hedgehog, oak trees, the common beech, the black alder, the brown bear, newts, shrews, water vole, silver fir and house mice. These molecular data confirm southern peninsulas of Europe as major ice age refugia, and in most cases demonstrate that genetically distinct taxa emerged from them. They can thus define genomic differences and so gready augment previous fossil data. The refugial genomes contributed differently in various species to die re-colonization of Europe, with three broad patterns described as paradigms–‘grasshopper’, ‘hedgehog’ and ‘bear’. These different expansion patterns produced clusters of hybrid zones where they made contact, and it is argued that many species genomes may be further cryptically subdivided. A reduction in diversity from southern to northern Europe in the extent of allelic variation and species subdivision is seen; this is attributed to rapid expansion northward and the varied topography of southern refugia allowing populations to diverge through several ice ages. The differences in DNA sequence indicate that some species have been diverging in refugial regions for a few ice ages at most, whilst distinct lineages in other species suggest much more ancient separation.},

As a result, fruit/flower and seed/ovule ratios were significantly lower under Papilio exclusion than under natural conditions. On the other hand, ratios were not significantly different between Papilio excluded and both Papilio and M. pyrrhosticta excluded treatments. Therefore, Papilio and X. appendiculata are effective pollinators, whereas M. pyrrhosticta, which was the most frequent visitor, of C. trichotomum, is not. From our observations of visiting behaviors, we believe that because M. pyrrhosticta probably promotes self- pollination, this species is a non-effective pollinator.

Here, we investigate the coevolution of these two components under fluctuating selection. Our analysis is based on the lottery model in which genetic polymorphism can be maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection, whereas environmental variation can be favored due to bet-hedging. In our model, phenotypes are characterized by a quantitative trait under stabilizing selection with the optimal phenotype fluctuating in time. Genotypes are characterized by their phenotypic offspring distribution, which is assumed to be Gaussian with heritable variation for its mean and variance. Polymorphism in the mean corresponds to genetic variance while the width of the offspring distribution corresponds to environmental variance. We show that increased environmental variance is favored whenever fluctuations in the selective optima are sufficiently strong. Given the environmental variance has evolved to its optimum, genetic polymorphism can still emerge if the distribution of selective optima is sufficiently asymmetric or leptokurtic. Polymorphism evolves in a diagonal direction in trait space: one type becomes a canalized specialist for the more common ecological conditions and the other type a de-canalized bet-hedger thriving on the less-common conditions.

We quantify and compare conservatism in the climatic factors defining range boundaries in extant continental mammals and amphibians in order to identify those factors that are most evolutionarily conserved, and thus hypothesized to have played a major role in determining the geographic distributions of many species. We also test whether amphibians show stronger signals of climatic niche conservatism, as expected from their greater physiological sensitivity and lower dispersal abilities.Location Global; continental land masses excluding Antarctica.Methods We used nearly complete global distributional databases to estimate the climatic niche conservatism in extant continental mammals and amphibians. We characterized the climatic niche of each species by using a suite of variables and separately investigate conservatism in each variable using both taxonomic and phylogenetic approaches. Finally, we explored the spatial, taxonomic and phylogenetic patterns in recent climatic niche evolution.Results Amphibians and mammals showed congruent patterns of conservatism in cold tolerance, with assemblages of escapee species (i.e. those escaping most from the climatic constraints of their ancestors) aggregated in the North Temperate Zone.Main conclusions The relative strength of climatic niche conservatism varies across the variables tested, but is strongest for cold tolerance in both mammals and amphibians. Despite the apparent conservatism in this variable, there is also a strong signal of recent evolutionary shifts in cold tolerance in assemblages inhabiting the North Temperate Zone. Our results thus indicate that distribution patterns of both taxa are influenced by both niche conservatism and niche evolution.},

Hypotheses based on allocation theory and herbivore selection patterns predict that defense should increase or decrease, respectively, across ontogeny, and previous research partly supports both predictions. Thus, it remains unclear which pattern is more common and what factors contribute to variability among studies. We conducted a meta‐analysis of 116 published studies reporting ontogenetic patterns in plant defense traits and herbivory. Patterns varied depending on plant life form (woody, herbaceous, grass), type of herbivore (insect, mollusk, mammal), and type of defense trait (secondary chemistry, physical defense, tolerance). In woody plants, chemical defense increased during the seedling stage, followed by an increase in physical defenses during the vegetative juvenile stage. Mammalian herbivores showed a strong preference for mature compared to juvenile tissues in woody plants. Herbs experienced a significant increase in secondary chemistry across the entire ontogenetic trajectory, although the magnitude of increase was greatest during the seedling stage. Correspondingly, mollusks preferred young compared to older herbs. Future research investigating growth/defense trade‐offs, allometry, herbivore selection patterns, and ecological costs would shed light on the mechanisms driving the ontogenetic patterns observed.},

	abstract = {Habitat diversification can influence the interactions of insects with plants and this can be used in agroecosystems for the management of pest populations. Plant diversification can be achieved through planting crops, such as trap crops, or by adjusting weed management. Aster leafhopper, Macrosteles quadrilineatus Forbes (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), is a polyphagous species that uses cereals, vegetables, and weeds as host plants. The influence of weeds on M. quadrilineatus abundance was investigated experimentally in carrot [Daucus carota L. cv. Canada (Apiaceae)] field plots by adjusting the level of management of two groups of weeds (broadleaf and grass) and by comparing it to weed-free plots. The preference of M. quadrilineatus for different cereal and weed species relative to carrots was tested in choice test assays. Habitat context influenced the abundance of M. quadrilineatus in the field experiments. The presence of border crops such as oat, rye, barley, wheat, and triticale did not significantly attract or repel this insect to carrot plots compared to the no-border treatment. However, spelt-bordered plots had 42\% fewer M. quadrilineatus than three treatments, triticale, wheat, and barley, that had the highest insect abundance. The type of weed management affected M. quadrilineatus abundance in carrot plots, but not the frequency of herbicide application. Plots that had carrot growing with broadleaf-weeds had about 59\% fewer M. quadrilineatus compared with those growing with crabgrass or carrot alone. In the greenhouse choice tests, grasses (e.g., cereals) attracted and broadleaf-weeds repelled M. quadrilineatus relative to carrots. In summary, carrot growers may be able to manage this pest by reducing the interaction of cereal cover crops with carrots and eliminating grassy weeds in commercial production fields.},

In choice experiments we investigated whether the compounds were preferred, deterrent or had no effect. All specialist species Aglaostigma discolor (Hymenoptera, Tenthredinidae), Oreina cacaliae (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae) and O. speciosissima avoided feeding when confronted with the combination of compounds. Only larvae of A. discolor avoided the single ST treatment as well. Larvae of the generalist species Callimorpha dominula (Lepidoptera, Arctiidae), Cylindrotoma distinctissima (Diptera, Tipulidae) and Miramella alpina (Caelifera, Acrididae) generally avoided feeding from PA, ST and PAST treatments. The only exception were caterpillars of C. dominula which were indiscriminate towards PA when naive, and preferred to feed on the PA treatment when they had experienced the compound before.Performance, measured as the growth of larvae on the different treatments in a no choice situation over a period of 10–17 days, was not different between treatments in the specialist leaf beetles O. cacaliae and O. speciosissima. Their avoidance of the combination treatment in the choice experiments had no obvious effect on growth when forced to feed from the treatment. In the generalist C. dominula only the high concentration combination treatment (PAST) reduced growth of the larvae due to decreased consumption. In C. distinctissima we found reduced growth in all treatments except one (PA3\%). Poor growth performance in C. distinctissima was due to postingestive physiological effects of all treatments and additionally to consumption reduction in high-dose ST treatments.Genetic variability (broad sense heritability) of growth performance metabolism varied in accordance with the specialization degree of the species. O. cacaliae, the most specialized species, had no significant heritability; O. speciosissima, the less specialized specialist, had a heritability of 0.46; C. dominula, the PA adapted generalist species, had a heritability of 0.64; C. distinctissima, the generalist with no apparent adaptations, had a heritability of 0.84.},

However, almost nothing is known about the interaction of this insect with its host plants. Previous studies have shown differences in the natural occurrence of adults, eggs, and nymphs on the closely related B. oleracea cultivars Christmas Drumhead and Riviera grown in the field. In this study, we aimed to identify the nature of these differences and to gain insight into the resistance mechanisms against A. proletella. We used no-choice experiments on field- and greenhouse-grown plants to show that the differences between the two cultivars are mainly based on antibiosis (traits that reduce herbivore performance) and not on antixenosis (traits that deter herbivory). This was further supported by laboratory choice experiments that indicated little or no discrimination between the two cultivars based on plant volatiles. We showed that resistance is dependent on plant age, that is, resistance increased during plant development, and is mainly independent of environmental factors. Analysis of probing behaviour revealed that the resistance trait affects A. proletella at the phloem level and that morphological differences between the two cultivars are most likely not involved. We suggest that compounds present in the phloem reduce sap ingestion by the whitefly and that this explains the observed resistance.},

The brief underwater submergence, once a week, of dead twigs bearing cicada egg nests resulted in high hatching rates both at 25 °C and under outdoor conditions protected from rainfall. Under outdoor conditions with natural rainfall, most eggs hatched on rainy days. There was a significant positive correlation between the number of hatching eggs and daily relative humidity (RH). When eggs picked from twigs were exposed to various humidity levels, many eggs hatched quickly at higher humidity without direct contact with liquid water. Newly hatched nymphs showed a low tolerance to desiccation; at 81\% RH at 25 °C, most of them died within 6 h. Under outdoor conditions, most nymphs died within 2 h on sunny days, whereas nymphs survived longer on rainy days. When newly hatched nymphs were released on dry ground, only 24\% of them succeeded in burrowing into the soil, and many were killed by ants or desiccation. However, 92\% of nymphs released onto wet ground successfully burrowed into it. The direct induction of hatching by high humidity ensures the survival and establishment in the soil of newly hatched nymphs in this species.},

To address the hypothesis, we have been studying the invasive viburnum leaf beetle (Pyrrhalta viburni), which is decimating North American native species of Viburnum, a clade of worldwide importance as understory shrubs and ornamentals. In a phylogenetic field experiment using 16 species of Viburnum, we show that old-world Viburnum species that evolved in the presence of Pyrrhalta beetles mount a massive defensive wound response that crushes eggs of the pest insect; in contrast, naïve North American species that share no evolutionary history with Pyrrhalta beetles show a markedly lower response. This convergent continental difference in the defensive response of Viburnum spp. against insect oviposition contrasts with little difference in the quality of leaves for beetle larvae. Females show strong oviposition preferences that correspond with larval performance regardless of continental origin, which has facilitated colonization of susceptible North American species. Thus, although much attention has been paid to escape from enemies as a factor in the establishment and spread of nonnative organisms, the colonization of undefended resources seems to play a major role in the success of invasive species such as the viburnum leaf beetle.},

We characterized the genetics of developmental variation and phenotypic plasticity in trichome density, a putative defensive trait of Mimulus guttatus (yellow monkeyflower). Our results are evaluated in relation to the optimal defense theory, which provides testable predictions for plastic and developmental patterns in defense traits. We found that both developmental stage and simulated insect damage affected trichome production, but in different ways. Plants were more likely to produce at least some trichomes on later leaves than on earlier leaves, regardless of damage. Damage did not affect the average probability of producing trichomes, but it did increase the density of hairs on trichome‐positive plants. We mapped trichome quantitative trait loci (QTL) by selectively genotyping a large panel of recombinant inbred lines derived from two highly divergent populations. Several highly pleiotropic QTL influenced multiple aspects of the trichome phenotype (constitutive, developmental, and/or plastic responses). Only one of the QTL influenced trichome induction following damage. In a result that is consistent with a central prediction of optimal defense theory, the high allele at this location was from the ancestral population with low constitutive trichome production.},

One component summarises the effects of fluctuation-independent mechanisms, which include classical resource partitioning and frequency-dependent herbivory. Two other components represent fluctuation-dependent mechanisms, the storage effect and relative nonlinearity of competition. The general model shows how a community will track an equilibrium set by fluctuation-independent mechanisms and the environmental state when community dynamics are faster than the rate of environmental change. Fluctuation-dependent mechanisms can be important for diversity maintenance with or without such tracking, but on long timescales their effects are indistinguishable from those of fluctuation-independent mechanisms. These considerations lead to a hierarchical view of mechanisms of diversity maintenance where the effects of different timescales are partitioned or merged depending on the timescale of observation. These issues are illustrated with model examples involving various combinations of resource partitioning, fluctuations in recruitment rates, variation in the timing of germination, and seasonality. The very long timescales associated with climate change contain many complexities but nevertheless many ideas applicable to shorter timescales may be useful in a modified form.},

In some circumstances there may be selection for a distinct heterozygote, in others for a state of "balanced dominance" in which the evolution of dominance proceeds to a certain level of resemblance between heterozygote and homozygote but not beyond it. It seems, however, that in most natural situations, frequency-dependent selection will promote the complete dominance of any allele which suffers a selective disadvantage that is independent of phenotype frequency.

The most likely long-term scenario was that the susceptible genotype outcompeted the resistant genotype.

	abstract = {Leaves of Datura wrightii in California (USA) are covered either with glandular trichomes ("sticky" plants) or non-glandular trichomes ("velvety" plants), and sticky plants are resistant to many insect herbivores. Theoretical models suggest that variation in resistance to herbivores may persist if resistance is costly and herbivore damage is variable. If so, then natural selection should favor resistant plants when damage is high and disfavor it when damage is low. However, without long-term equivalence between costs and benefits, then natural selection either should drive the trait to fixation if it has a net benefit or eliminate it if it has a net cost. Previously we showed that the production of glandular trichomes carried a net cost in short-term studies, suggesting that this expensive resistant trait might be eliminated from D. wrightii populations. To test this hypothesis we monitored survival and seed production of sticky and velvety D. wrightii in the presence of herbivores in 11 natural populations over four or five years. In eight populations where both types occurred, the finite rate of increase for velvety plants was 60-274\% greater than for sticky plants. Plant survival averaged between two and three years and did not differ significantly between types. Because seed production consistently favored velvety plants, our prediction that the proportion of sticky plants should decline was met within five years in seven of those eight populations. If the variation in trichome morphology in D. wrightii is indeed maintained by variation in costs and benefits of glandular trichomes, then the periodicity of such variation extends over more than five seasons.},

Coexistence mechanisms can be classified into two groups on the basis of whether they reduce inherent differences in species performance (equalizing effects) or buffer against extinction by providing advantages to rare species (stabilizing effects). Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that rapid evolution can increase equalizing and/or stabilizing effects in several ways. Directional evolutionary changes can result in new ecological conditions that are more equal or stable than the initial state. Additionally, coevolution between competitors or consumers can lead to cyclic dynamics that provide novel evolutionary equalizing or stabilizing effects.},

	abstract = {The fatty acid hydroperoxide (HP) substrates required for the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA) and green leaf volatiles (GLVs) are supplied by separate lipoxygenases (LOX). We silenced the expression of two genes downstream of the LOX: allene oxide synthase (AOS) and HP lyase (HPL) by antisense expression of endogenous genes (NaAOS, NaHPL) in Nicotiana attenuata, in which the biosynthesis of JA is amplified by herbivore-specific elicitors. We report that these elicitors also amplify wound-induced GLV releases, but suppress the wound-induced increase of NaHPL transcripts, suggesting that substrate flux controls GLV biosynthesis. As expected, silencing of NaHPL and NaAOS reduced GLV release and JA accumulation, respectively. Surprisingly, HPL- and AOS-silenced plants had enhanced JA and GLV responses, suggesting substrate ‘crosstalk’ between these two oxylipin cascades. Plants with depleted GLVs (as-hpl) were less attractive than wild type (WT) or empty vector control plants in choice-tests with native lepidopteran herbivores. In feeding trials, Manduca sexta larvae developed slower on as-hpl plants. The reduced larval consumption and performance, which was not caused by increases in defense responses in as-hpl plants, could be restored to WT levels by the addition of synthetic GLVs, demonstrating that GLVs function as feeding stimulants. Gene expression profiling by cDNA microarray analysis and characterization of several induced defenses in herbivore-elicited as-hpl and as-aos plants revealed differential involvement of JA and GLVs in defense signaling. Elicitation of volatile terpenoids (an indirect defense) requires JA signaling, where as trypsin protease inhibitor elicitation (a direct defense) requires both functional JA and GLV cascades.},

	abstract = {A bioassay arena was developed to test the response of the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica Newman (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), to various plant-derived factors that may influence the selection of oviposition sites. In choice experiments with natural and artificial plant cues, females preferred to lay eggs in ryegrass rather than in artificial resources. Artificial grass stems received more eggs on average than bare ground, indicating the role of vertical objects on the soil surface as oviposition cues. Popillia japonica females were able to discriminate between the quality and quantity of the artificial stems, as more eggs were laid in soil blocks that had larger diameter stems or a higher number of stems per soil block. Beetles were capable of evaluating plant characteristics on the soil surface and adjusted their investment accordingly; more eggs were laid in resources that were chosen more frequently. Observations of females in choice arenas revealed how surface cues influence digging behavior and the time spent under the soil surface. The number of digging events was not significantly different among the three treatments with surface cues (ryegrass, grass roots, and artificial grass), but beetles spent significantly more time in the soil under ryegrass than any of the other treatments. These findings suggest that oviposition by P. japonica is selective and is influenced by plant-derived cues evaluated before and after digging into the soil.},

	abstract = {Indirect effects may play an important role in structuring plant communities. Using a spatially explicit model of consumer foraging and plant competition, we demonstrate how the relationship between the spatial area over which plants compete and the spatial scale of consumer behaviour can determine the outcome of competition when one plant species provides a refuge for mobile consumers (i.e. refuge-mediated apparent competition). Once an initial population of the invader is established, complete invasion may be inevitable because of an ever-advancing invasion front ratchets forward driven by a feeding front of mobile consumers. Because the spatial extent of apparent competition determines the area available for colonization, consumers may also dictate the rate at which an invasion occurs. We find that, as long as refuge-mediated apparent competition is sufficiently localized, invasion is possible even in systems characterized by low overall levels of consumer pressure. Moreover, we show that a stable equilibrium can result in which both resident and invading plants coexist, suggesting that spatial heterogeneity created by refuge-mediated apparent competition may be important in mediating coexistence in plant communities. The spatial interplay of consumer behaviour and plant competition may be an underappreciated mechanism affecting the composition, diversity and spatial pattern of plant communities.},

	abstract = {According to the "effective pollination" hypothesis, tall stature resulting from strong apical dominance attracts greater pollinator visitation, thus allowing larger pollen loads and/or greater outcrossing rates, which in turn produces more vigorous offspring with greater genotypic variability and/or less inbreeding depression. Components of this hypothesis were tested in Verbascum thapsus, which commonly grows unbranched to over 2 m tall with strong apical dominance suppressing all axillary meristems. A natural population survey indicated that plants with visiting pollinators were significantly taller than their nearest neighboring individuals not possessing a visiting pollinator. Plants in natural populations with excluded pollinators produced seeds via a delayed selfing mechanism. However, delayed selfing under pollinator exclusion resulted in only 75\% of the seed set obtained with natural pollinators. Under natural pollination, emasculated flowers experienced a 50\% reduction in pollen deposition by the time of flower closure but only a 5\% reduction in seed set relative to intact flowers. Hence, taller plants attracted more pollinators and maximum seed set could not be achieved without pollinators. Comparison of seed set and seed mass in plants that were artificially selfed and artificially crossed (in both the greenhouse and in natural populations) indicated that plants were fully self-compatible with no evidence of early-acting inbreeding depression. However, this does not exclude the possibility that inbreeding depression is manifested in later life stages. The results suggest that V. thapsus has a mixed mating system with potential for reproductive assurance and various levels of outcrossing depending on variables affecting pollinator availability (e.g., population size).},

	abstract = {We analyse the population dynamics of two strains of bacteria (Escherichia coli): one strain produces a toxin (called colicin) that increases the mortality of a colicin-sensitive strain in the neighbourhood, but does not harm the colicin-producing strain itself. On the other hand, in the absence of colicin in the environment, the colicin-sensitive strain enjoys a higher population growth rate. The model is closely related to the evolutionary dynamics of social interaction. It has been established previously that a perfectly mixing population shows bistability; that is, whichever strain dominates initially tends to defeat the other. On the other hand, empirical and computer simulation results in lattice structured populations show neither co-existence nor bistability of the two strains. In this paper, we analyse the lattice model based on pair approximation (forming a system of ordinary differential equations of global densities and local densities), and by the direct c omputer simulation of the spatial stochastic model. Both the pair approximation dynamics and the computer simulation show that, for most regions of parameter values, one strain defeats the other, irrespective of the initial abundance. However, the pair approximation analysis also suggests a relatively narrow parameter region of bistability, which should disappear when the model is considered on a lattice of infinitely large size. The biological implications of the results and the relationship of the present model with other models of the evolution of spite or altruistic behaviours are discussed. This suggests that the dynamics reflected by the spatially explicit lattice model may be sufficient, perhaps even necessary, to support the evolution of colicin.},

We illustrate our approach using two worked examples, concerning the emergence of toxin resistance within microbial communities, and the estimation of carbon uptake by marine phytoplankton in high-CO2 environments. We find that this approach allows us to exclude particular mechanistic hypotheses with regard to community-level transformations, and to identify specific instances where appropriate data are lacking.

	abstract = {1. Genetic variability in the relationship between plant size and fecundity (fecundity allocation) was investigated in 10 inbred lines (genotypes) of Arabidopsis thaliana. For each genotype, a range of plant sizes was established by planting seeds at various densities. Plant size (above-ground biomass excluding seeds), fecundity (number of seeds produced), and percentage germination of seeds were recorded for 20 individuals representative of the range of plant size displayed for each genotype as a result of the density treatments. 2. There was a significant \$(P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001)\$ positive relationship between plant size and fecundity for all genotypes. Size–fecundity regressions were primarily linear within the range investigated and the slopes differed significantly between genotypes. The y intercepts were either significantly positive or not different from zero. Seed viability generally did not depend on the number of seeds produced. 3. Genotypes with relatively large maximum plant sizes had relatively low fecundities. This trade-off is consistent with r/K-selection theory; such genotypes are regarded as having a `K-type strategy'. There is no basis for predicting, however, that such a `strategy' will confer superior fitness in contexts of competition. 4. The rank-order of fecundity was not consistent for all plant sizes. Individual genotypes with greater-than-average fecundity when relatively large in size tended to have lower-than-average fecundity when smaller, whilst the converse was true for genotypes having lower-than-average fecundity when relatively large. 5. The results indicate that absolute allocation to fecundity at a given plant size, and the variation in fecundity allocation across different sizes, can vary significantly at the level of the genotype in this species. This may be an important component in defining differences in fitness between individuals in the context of competition.},

In addition, we examined the effects of methanol–water extracts of L. maackii leaves on seed germination of a target plant species and on feeding preference and growth rate of a generalist insect herbivore. A total of 13 individual major and minor compounds were detected in crude leaf extracts by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electronspray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). Extracts were dominated by two major flavones, apigenin and luteolin, and their glucoside derivatives, apigenin-7-glucoside and luteolin-7-glucoside. Quantities of these compounds, along with chlorogenic acid, varied between two sampling points. Leaf extracts that contained these compounds were inhibitory to seed germination of Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition, treatment of artificial diet with leaf extracts deterred feeding of the generalist herbivore, Spodoptera exigua, in choice experiments but had no effect on growth rate in short-term no-choice bioassays. Purified apigenin tended to deter feeding by S. exigua and inhibited seed germination of A. thaliana. We conclude that leaves of L. maackii contain phenolic compounds, including apigenin and chlorogenic acid, capable of having biological effects on other plants and insects.},

Data from 10 published experiments on semi-natural and agricultural grasslands in Scotland, and from published information on plant traits, were used to determine whether (a) species and trait attributes behave consistently with respect to changing grazing intensity at sites of different productivity and (b) whether species and attribute responses to grazing were affected by site productivity.2Only 9 out of 22 species common enough to show a consistent response to grazing did so. For example, Deschampsia flexuosa and Molinia caerulea declined when grazing intensity increased, whilst Anthoxanthum odouratum and Cerastium fontanum increased. A similar proportion (12/29) of traits behaved consistently between studies.3Increased grazing intensity was accompanied by an increase in species with a ruderal strategy, an annual life history, seasonal regeneration by seed, flowering and seed dispersal early in the season, rosette habit, higher requirement for light and a lower minimum height.4The response of five species was modified by site productivity. In four cases, the effect was to modulate the rate of response to grazing change. In contrast, Nardus stricta increased with grazing at low productivity sites, but decreased at high productivity sites. Many more traits (22), including attributes related to life history, life form, and vegetative and sexual reproduction, showed a response to grazing modulated by productivity. Eight of these changed in a complex manner, akin to that of N. stricta.5The response of some species and traits to grazing appears predictable. However, for some species and many traits either the rate or the direction of response is controlled by the productivity of the vegetation.},

	abstract = {Proliferation of exotic submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) has the potential to alter trophic interactions among native fauna. The invasion of Myriophyllum spicatum (Eurasian watermilfoil) into brackish and freshwater wetlands on the Gulf Coast of the United States has decreased the abundance of native plant species such as Ruppia maritima (widgeongrass). Macroinvertebrates use SAV to meet nutritional requirements and seek refuge from predators. Shifts in SAV dominance can alter patterns of SAV use by associated fauna, but the dynamics of these alterations following Myriophyllum displacement of Ruppia are not well understood. In our study, we examined the trophic implications of shifts between native (Ruppia) and exotic (Myriophyllum) SAV in a brackish wetland in Port Arthur, Texas, USA. This study addressed the following questions: 1) Do aquatic invertebrates directly consume Myriophyllum, and 2) do predator–prey interactions differ in native and exotic SAV canopies? We collected Ruppia, Myriophyllum, Palaemonetes spp. (grass shrimp), and juvenile Callinectes sapidus (blue crabs) from the field and ran a series of three mesocosm experiments in the laboratory. In a “no-choice” grazing experiment, Palaemonetes consumed 13\% of the Ruppia biomass but had no impact on Myriophyllum biomass. In a second study, when given a choice of plant canopies, Palaemonetes selected Ruppia over Myriophyllum 60\% of the time when Callinectes was absent, but selected Myriophyllum more frequently in the presence of Callinectes. The selection of Myriophyllum was likely due to its refuge value; a third mesocosm experiment resulted in 60\% Palaemonetes mortality due to Callinectes predation in Ruppia canopies but only 20\% mortality in Myriophyllum canopies. Myriophyllum has a more structurally complex canopy that probably provides better protection from predation. Our studies suggest that native and exotic plants provide substantially different values as food sources and as refuges from predators for lower trophic levels.},

	url = {http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/content/103/8/1279.abstract},
	abstract = {Background and Aims Variation in fitness depends on corresponding variation in multiple traits which have both genetically controlled and plastic components. These traits are subjected to varying degrees of local adaptation in specific populations and, consequently, are genetically controlled to different extents. In this study it is hypothesized that modulation of different traits would have contrasting relevance for the fitness of populations of diverse origins. Specifically, assuming that environmental pressures vary across a latitudinal gradient, it is suggested that inherited variation in traits differentially determines fitness in annual Lupinus angustifolius populations from contrasting latitudinal origins in western Spain.Methods Seeds of L. angustifolius from three contrasting origins were grown in a common garden. Traits related to more plastic vegetative growth and more genetically conserved phenology were measured, together with estimates of reproductive success. Fitness was estimated by the number of viable seeds per plant. Structural Equation Models were used to infer causal relationships among multiple traits and fitness, separating the direct and indirect effects of morphological, phenological and reproductive traits.Key Results Phenological, vegetative and reproductive traits accounted for most of the fitness variation. Fitness was highest in plants of southernmost origin, mainly due to earlier flowering. Fitness within each seed origin was controlled by variation in different traits. Southern origin plants that grew to a larger size achieved higher fitness. However, plant size in plants of northernmost origin was irrelevant, but early flowering promoted higher fitness. Variation in fruit and seed set had a greater effect on the fitness of plants of central origin than phenological and size variation.Conclusions It is concluded that modulation of a functional trait can be relevant to fitness in a given population (i.e. affecting intensity and direction), but irrelevant in other populations. This points to the need to consider integrated phenotypes when trying to unravel local adaptation effects over single traits.},

We study this question using a model of prey defenses in which prey can induce any level of defense conditional on cues that are informative of local predator density. The model incorporates a trade-off between defense expression and fecundity and feedback between the defense level of prey and predator attack rates. Both continuous reaction norms and threshold traits can emerge as evolutionarily stable solutions of defense induction, and we show that the shape of the trade-off curve plays a key role in determining the outcome. Threshold traits are favored when selection is disruptive. Ecological conditions that favor defense dimorphisms in the absence of cues will favor threshold traits in the presence of slightly informative cues. We caution that continuous reaction norms and threshold traits may result in similar patterns of defense expression at the population level, and we discuss potential pitfalls of inferring reaction norm type from observational data.},

	abstract = {Glucosinolates are a diverse group of defensive secondary metabolites that is characteristic of the Brassicales. Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. (Brassicaceae) lines with mutations that greatly reduce abundance of indole glucosinolates (cyp79B2 cyp79B3), aliphatic glucosinolates (myb28 myb29), or both (cyp79B2 cyp79B3 myb28 myb29) make it possible to test the in vivo defensive function of these two major glucosinolate classes. In experiments with Lepidoptera that are not crucifer-feeding specialists, aliphatic and indole glucosinolates had an additive effect on Spodoptera exigua (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larval growth, whereas Trichoplusia ni (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Manduca sexta (L.) (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) were affected only by the absence of aliphatic glucosinolates. In the case of two crucifer-feeding specialists, Pieris rapae (L.) (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) and Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), there were no major changes in larval performance due to decreased aliphatic and/or indole glucosinolate content. Nevertheless, choice tests show that aliphatic and indole glucosinolates act in an additive manner to promote larval feeding of both species and P. rapae oviposition. Together, these results support the hypothesis that a diversity of glucosinolates is required to limit the growth of multiple insect herbivores.},

We thereby show a causal link between variation in abundance of the two specialist aphids and the geographic pattern at GS-ELONG, which highlights the potency of natural enemies as selective forces.},

	abstract = {Blooms of the toxic cyanobacteria Lyngbya spp. have been increasing in frequency and severity in southeast Florida in recent years. Lyngbya produces many active secondary metabolites which often act as feeding deterrents to generalist herbivores, possibly increasing the longevity of these nuisance blooms. Whilst diverse arrays of small invertebrate consumers are often found in association with Lyngbya, little is known of their grazing selectivity among species of Lyngbya. This study examines the feeding preference of grazers for four local Lyngbya species (Lyngbya majuscula, Lyngbya confervoides, Lyngbya polychroa and Lyngbya spp.). Stylocheilus striatus and Haminoea antillarum showed no dietary selectivity between L. polychroa, L. majuscula and Lyngbya spp. in multiple choice feeding assays, whereas Bulla striata showed a distinct preference for L. polychroa (P \&lt; 0.001). To determine whether preference might be related to species-specific secondary metabolites, L. majuscula, L. confervoides and L. polychroa non-polar and polar extracts were incorporated into artificial diets and offered to a range of mesograzers. No significant difference was noted in feeding stimulation or deterrence amongst extracts and the controls for any of the grazers. When fed a monospecific diet of L. polychroa, S. striatus consumed more (P \&lt; 0.001) and attained a higher daily biomass (P = 0.004) than S. striatus fed L. confervoides. As L. polychroa and L. confervoides often co-exist on local coral reefs and yield dense numbers of S. striatus, host switching to a more palatable species of Lyngbya may have important implications regarding top-down control of local blooms leading to proliferation of one species and decimation of another. S. striatus fed a diet of L. polychroa consumed more (P = 0.003), had a greater increase in body mass (P = 0.020) and higher conversion efficiency (P = 0.005) than those fed L. confervoides regardless of host origin. Possible explanations for host switching between species of Lyngbya related to morphology, toxicity and nutrient requirements for growth are discussed.},

We recognize a common pattern of phylogenetic conservatism in ecological character and highlight the challenges of using phylogenies of partial lineages. We also review phylogenetic approaches to three emergent properties of communities: species diversity, relative abundance distributions, and range sizes. Methodological advances in phylogenetic supertree construction, character reconstruction, null models for community assembly and character evolution, and metrics of community phylogenetic structure underlie the recent progress in these areas.

	abstract = {Plants can employ two general strategies to defend themselves against herbivory: they can either reduce the amount of damage they experience (resistance), or they can tolerate herbivore damage. Theoretical considerations suggest that, in many cases, tolerance and resistance are redundant strategies, and may therefore be mutually exclusive adaptations. In this investigation of natural populations of the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana we examine whether the pattern of selection acting on resistance and tolerance favors the evolution of one defense strategy, or the other, but not both. We found that the joint pattern of selection acting on tolerance and two resistance traits, trichome density and total glucosinolate concentration, indicated that there were not alternate peaks in the fitness landscape favoring either resistance or tolerance. Rather, selection favored the retention of both tolerance and resistance. One reason for the absence of mutually exclusive alternative resistance/tolerance strategies is the absence of a negative genetic correlation between resistance and tolerance. An unexpected result is the detection of disruptive selection acting on tolerance, which seems to result from a nonlinear relationship between tolerance and its costs.},

The species show a marked preference for the same microhabitat, although gerbils also inhabit a second microhabitat where predation risk is greater. We provide direct experimental evidence for the role of predation risk and both inter- and intraspecific competition in affecting foraging behavior and habitat selection of gerbils. Using two techniques (tracking and seed trays), we were able to show that gerbils decrease foraging activity in vegetated areas during periods of increased illumination (full-moon periods). Removal of a potential competitor, the striped mouse, as well as removal of conspecifics, resulted in a significant increase in gerbil foraging activity. We propose that high susceptibility to predation results in a shared preference for the safest habitat and leads to competition for limited resources.},

Mice presented with diets containing caffeine or rauwolfia alkaloids did not increase food consumption following a period of depressed food intake. These mice did not exhibit increased rates of detoxification through time. Mice presented with tannic acid diets increased their food intake through time, although this was not based on enhanced rates of microsomal detoxification. Mice presented with a choice of caffeine and rauwolfia, caffeine and tannic acid or rauwolfia and tannic acid diets ate from both food sources. Quantities of each toxic food eaten were dependent on the choice presented. Mice presented with dietary choices failed to ingest more food per unit time than mice presented with one of the toxic diets. These mice also failed to exhibit detoxification based increases in ingestion through time. Patterns of diet choice and mixing of diets appeared to result from the mice attempting to minimize the negative effects of individual toxins. Even gross patterns of weight gain, rates of ingestion and costs of detoxification appear unpredictable in the absence of information specific to the particular herbivore and the idiosyncratic physiologies of individual toxins. Interactions among toxins may have required generalist herbivores to evolve tolerances to and detoxification mechanisms for, highly select combinations of plant secondary compounds. Evolution in response to plant defences may provide a basis for interpreting niche definition and community structure of herbivorous mammals.},

	abstract = {In most populations of Solidago altissima, a small proportion of plants have a growth pattern in which the stem bends early in the season so that the apex is pointing downward (i.e., a “candy-cane” stem) then straightens up again later in the season. The majority of plants, however, do not show this pattern. Instead their stems remain erect from emergence through flowering and senescence. It has recently been shown that the candy-cane stems are a result of a ducking strategy that reduces the risk of attack by apex-attacking herbivores. With such a resistance advantage, it is unclear why the candy-cane morphology is always in the minority, and why the erect morphology persists at all in S. altissima populations. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the advantage of ducking is inversely frequency dependent and thus will not be an effective resistance strategy when ducking plants are in the majority. In a series of trials, we introduced gall flies (Eurosta solidaginis) into enclosures with relatively low (15\%) and relatively high (85\%) frequencies of candy-cane versus erect stems. Candy-cane stems were more resistant than erect stems regardless of relative frequency; thus, the hypothesis was rejected. Overall, attack rates were lower for both stem types in the high candy-cane frequency groups than in the low candy-cane frequency groups. This frequency-dependent attack rate suggests that erect-stemmed plants gain “associational resistance” by having a majority of candy-cane neighbors, while candy-cane plants suffer from “associational susceptibility” when surrounded by erect-stemmed neighbors.},

The classic models generally start with the idea of a single randomly mating population that has reached an evolutionary equilibrium. Many models relax some of these assumptions, allowing for phenomena such as assortative mating, discrete sub-populations with migration, self-fertilization, and sex-ratio distortion. Virtually all models, however, have as their core premise the notion that there exist classes of exchangeable individuals each of which represents an identical, independent sample from that class' distribution. For certain organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, these models do an excellent job of describing how populations work. For other organisms, such as humans, these models can be reasonable approximations but require a great deal of care in assembling samples and can begin to break down as sampling becomes locally dense. For the vast majority of organisms the applicability of these models has never been investigated.},

We first critically assess the evidence for the existence of self/non-self and kin recognition at the root level in plants. While root identity recognition most likely exists to some degree, there remain valid points of criticism regarding experiments that have documented this, particularly concerning the effects of pot volume in self/non-self recognition experiments and the roles of size inequality and asymmetric competition in kin recognition studies. Subsequently we review and propose some plausible physiological mechanisms that may underlie these responses. Finally we briefly discuss the relation between under- and aboveground interactions and the potential consequences of root identity recognition for agriculture, and conclude with raising several questions for future studies.},

	abstract = {The susceptibility of plants to attack by insect herbivores often depends on local environmental conditions. This study documents variation in herbivore damage by the chrysomelid beetle Erynephala maritima to the annual forb Atriplex patula in two microhabitats within New England salt marshes: bare patches and dense matrix vegetation. Environmental conditions within bare patches differ from those within matrix vegetation in a number of ways. Bare patches are characterized by the absence of perennial grasses and rushes (matrix vegetation) and greater levels of physical stress, and are rapidly colonized by the fugitive annual, Salicornia europaea , a second host plant of these beetles. Surveys of herbivore damage across three marshes revealed that A. patula in bare patches had a greater proportion of leaves damaged by beetles than those within matrix vegetation. Presence or absence of matrix vegetation and presence or absence of S. europaea were experimentally manipulated to determine the proximate cause of this pattern. The presence of S. europaea significantly increased the susceptibility of A. patula to herbivory in experimental plots. Both the extent of herbivore damage to plants and the proportion of plants damaged through time were greater in treatments with S. europaea than in controls, regardless of the presence or absence of matrix vegetation. Plants in S. europaea addition treatments were also less likely to survive to reproduction. Decreased survival appears to result from increased herbivory, suggesting that the negative effect of S. europaea on A. patula is mediated indirectly through shared insect herbivores. These results support the hypothesis that indirect interactions between alternative host plants, mediated by insect herbivores, can be important in natural communities.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims Although most studies on plant defence strategies have focused on a particular defence trait, some plant species develop multiple defence traits. To clarify the effects of light on the development of multiple defence traits, the production of direct and indirect defence traits of young plants of Mallotus japonicus were examined experimentally under different light conditions. Methods The young plants were cultivated under three light conditions in the experimental field for 3 months from May to July. Numbers of ants and pearl bodies on leaves in July were examined. After cultivation, the plants were collected and the developments of trichomes and pellucid dots, and extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) on the leaves were examined. On plants without nectar-collecting insects, the size of EFNs and the volume of extrafloral nectar secreted from the EFNs were examined. Key results Densities of trichomes and pellucid dots did not differ significantly among the plants under the different light conditions, suggesting that the chemical and physical defences function under both high and low light availability. The number of EFNs on the leaves did not differ significantly among the plants under the different light conditions, but there appeared to be a trade-off between the size of EFNs and the number of pearl bodies; the largest EFNs and the smallest number of pearl bodies were found under high light availability. EFN size was significantly correlated with the volume of extrafloral nectar secreted for 24 h. The number of ants on the plants was smaller under low light availability than under high and moderate light availability. Conclusions These results suggest that direct defence traits function regardless of light conditions, but light conditions affected the development of indirect defence traits.},

	abstract = {Herbivore adaptation to plant resistance presents an evolutionary trade-off for plants. In the absence of plant resistance the plant is susceptible to non-adapted herbivores. However herbivores that are adapted to a particular plant resistance trait may increase the cost to the plant of expressing the trait if the herbivores use it as an attractant. The adapted herbivore escape hypothesis suggests that plants may get around this problem by only deploying the resistance when necessary in response to herbivore feeding. This hypothesis requires that adapted herbivore are able to discriminate in favour of resistant plants when making host choice decisions and that host selection is frequency-dependent such that the undamaged phenotype can escape when rare. This thesis set out to determine how host phenotype frequency affects choice by insect herbivores in both a mechanistic and a functional sense. In addition, a study was made of the conditions under which induced strategies may be evolutionary stable when under selection by adapted and non-adapted herbivores in the absence of physiological costs of defence. The role of learning and host-deprivation in the oviposition acceptance behaviour of the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutridae)) was investigated. Previous experience with a host plant increased acceptance in a host-specific way. Discrimination between host plants was independent of deprivation. Existing models of insect oviposition acceptance do not adequately explain these findings. A new model- The Incremental Acceptance Model- is proposed. In laboratory trials containing mixtures of damaged and undamaged Brassica oleraceae L. and B. napus L. plants at different frequencies, a key assumption of the adapted herbivore escape hypothesis was supported. The probability of oviposition by the diamondback moth was dependent on the frequency-of the damaged state and undamaged Brassica plants were more likely to escape herbivory than were damaged plants. The larval rearing plant affected the oviposition preference of the moths for damaged plants. The evolution of plant defence strategies was modelled under frequency-dependent selection by nonadapted and adapted, or partially adapted herbivores. A stable state always arose that contained both the defended and undefended plant phenotypes, except under certain restrictive conditions. Inducibility formed a pure ESS provided the defended phenotype was not fitter than the undefended phenotype and the plant defence reduced the feeding damage by non-adapted herbivores. In contrast with previous models, induction is not necessarily favoured when herbivory is predictable or the costs of expressing defence intermediate. It is argued that frequency-dependent herbivory is a major omission from previous studies of the evolution of plant defence strategies.},

	abstract = {Abstract: On the basis of single‐locus models, spatial heterogeneity of the environment coupled with strong population regulation within each habitat (soft selection) is considered an important mechanism maintaining genetic variation. We studied the capacity of soft selection to maintain polygenic variation for a trait determined by several additive loci, selected in opposite directions in two habitats connected by dispersal. We found three main types of stable equilibria. Extreme equilibria are characterized by extreme specialization to one habitat and loss of polymorphism. They are analogous to monomorphic equilibria in singe‐locus models and are favored by similar factors: high dispersal, weak selection, and low marginal average fitness of intermediate genotypes. At the remaining two types of equilibria the population mean is intermediate but variance is very different. At fully polymorphic equilibria all loci are polymorphic, whereas at low‐variance equilibria at most one locus remains polymorphic. For most parameters only one type of equilibrium is stable; the transition between the domains of fully polymorphic and low‐variance equilibria is typically sharp. Low‐variance equilibria are favored by high marginal average fitness of intermediate genotypes, in contrast to single‐locus models, in which marginal overdominance is particularly favorable for maintenance of polymorphism. The capacity of soft selection to maintain polygenic variation is thus more limited than extrapolation from single‐locus models would suggest, in particular if dispersal is high and selection weak. This is because in a polygenic model, variance can evolve independently of the mean, whereas in the single‐locus two‐allele case, selection for an intermediate mean automatically leads to maintenance of polymorphism.},

	abstract = {1. Plant ecophysiological investigations often fail to account for age-specific, tissue-or organ-specific, or life-history-specific effects on overall performance. To address this issue, aspects of gas exchange and water relations of a deciduous and dioecious dwarf willow, Salix arctica, were examined. The degree of physiological variation that occurred as leaves aged was investigated, within and among vegetative and reproductive ramets of a plant's canopy, and between the sexes. 2. Significant differences were observed in rates of photosynthetic carbon assimilation, dark respiration and stomatal conductance, as well as in bulk tissue water relations of leaves at different ages, between reproductive and vegetative ramets within an individual, and between male and female individuals. Developing leaves had lower rates of carbon assimilation (A) and stomatal conductance (g), but higher rates of dark respiration (R$_{\textrm{d}}$$_{\textrm{d}}$\$, as well as higher levels of TNC, but a lower tolerance to both tissue water deficits and increased Δ w when compared with vegetative ramets. The enhanced rates of gas exchange in reproductive ramets may have resulted from a greater sink strength produced by the presence of catkins. 4. These results suggest that physiological variation at several different levels of organization can be quite significant. Accounting for such variation is important: (a) if accurate extrapolations of leaf- or shoot-level performance to whole-plant canopies are to be successful, (b) if an adaptive explanation for variation in physiological properties within a canopy in terms of maximizing whole-plant performance is desired, (c) if a detailed understanding of the magnitude of individual-level and population-level variation is desired, and (d) if the goal is to be able to construct a detailed picture of what contributes to whole-plant performance, or (e) to characterize accurately a species' ecophysiological breadth within or across environments that are heterogeneous in both time and space.},

Development and oviposition of the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), were studied in relation to varying N fertilization levels (42, 112, 196, and 280 p.p.m.) in cotton [Gossypium hirsutum L. (Malvaceae)]. Low N fertilization of cotton plants led to reduced plant biomass and a lower percentage of N in leaf blades and in leaf petioles. Development of S. exigua larvae fed with plants with reduced N applications (42 and 112 p.p.m.) was prolonged relative to treatments receiving higher N fertilization. Almost all larvae reared on artificial diets underwent only five instars before pupation. However, most larvae reared on cotton plants, irrespective of N levels, experienced a supernumerary sixth larval instar. Furthermore, significantly more larvae reared on lower N cotton plants underwent supernumerary development compared to larvae reared on higher N cotton plants. Life-time feeding damage per larva ranged from 55 to 65 cm2, depending on the nutritional quality of the food plant, although the differences were not statistically significant. Larvae distinguished between cotton plants with various nutritional qualities and fed preferentially on higher N plants. Female moth oviposition choice was also affected by host plant nutritional quality: cotton plants with higher N levels were preferentially chosen by S. exigua females for oviposition. The mechanisms of these effects are unclear, but they can have important implications for population dynamics and pest status of beet armyworms in the field.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary causes of variation in host specialization among phytophagous insects are still not well understood and identifying them is a central task in insect–host plant biology. Here we examine host utilization of the chrysomelid beetle Oreina elongata that shows interpopulation variation in the degree of specialization. We focus on larval behaviour and on what selection pressures may favour the use of two different larval host plants (Adenostyles alliariae and Cirsium spinosissimum) in one population as opposed to specialization onto one of them as is seen in other populations. The results suggest that the degree of exploratory foraging behaviour is higher in larvae from the two-host population than in single host populations, and a field survey of the two-host population also indicated that larvae do move between host species. A field experiment indicated that predation rates on O. elongata larvae in the two-host population are higher on one of the host species, A. alliariae, than on the alternative C. spinosissimum. In combination with earlier results this finding suggest that larvae move between hosts to obtain better food on one host, and to get better protection from predators on the other. It appears that in this two-host situation a single plant species does not provide the most beneficial conditions in all parts of O. elongata life cycle and individuals may obtain different plant-specific benefits by moving between host species. This heterogeneous host situation appears to have selected for the explorative larval foraging strategy seen in the in the two-host population. In general, the results support the notion that to understand patterns of host plant use in insects it is often vital to consider a range of host related selection pressures whose relative importance may vary between life stages of the insect.},

	abstract = {The Allee effect is a positive causal relationship between any component of fitness and population density or size. Allee effects strongly affect the persistence of small or sparse populations. Predicting Allee effects remains a challenge, possibly because not all causal mechanisms are known. We hypothesized that reproductive interference (an interspecific reproductive interaction that reduces the fitness of the species involved) can generate an Allee effect. If the density of the interfering species is constant, an increase in the population of the species receiving interference may dilute the per capita effect of reproductive interference and may generate an Allee effect. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of heterospecific males on the relationship between per capita fecundity and conspecific density in Callosobruchus chinensis and C. maculatus . Of the two species, only C. maculatus females suffer reproductive interference from heterospecific males. Only C. maculatus , the species susceptible to reproductive interference, demonstrated an Allee effect, and only when heterospecific males were present. In contrast, C. chinensis , the species not susceptible to reproductive interference, demonstrated no Allee effect regardless of the presence of heterospecific males. Our results show that reproductive interference in fact generated an Allee effect, suggesting the potential importance of interspecific sexual interactions especially in small or sparse populations, even in the absence of a shared resource. It may be possible to predict Allee effects produced by this mechanism a priori by testing reproductive interference between closely related species.},

	abstract = {Larvae of several tenthredinid sawfly species readily release droplets of haemolymph through their integument when attacked by predators. This defence mechanism via 'bleeding' is characterised by a low integument resistance and a high haemolymph deterrence. Both traits are variable, and negatively correlated among species. We sought to determine if such differences in the propensity to bleed also occur intraspecifically by studying the heritability of traits potentially associated with the bleeding phenomenon in the turnip sawfly Athalia rosae ruficornis Jakovlev (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae, Allantinae). For three European populations, heritabilities were estimated in the laboratory in a parent–offspring and a full-sib design for haemolymph deterrence (measured as concentration of sequestered glucosinolate), integument resistance, body mass of eonymph and adult, and developmental time. Within A. rosae, no significant negative phenotypic correlation was found between the two traits directly related to the defence mechanism: integument resistance and haemolymph deterrence. However, the significant heritabilities found for these traits in the full-sib analysis (0.39 and 0.35, respectively, for males in the Swiss population) show that the variation has a genetic component. While full-sib analysis revealed highly significant heritabilities for most traits in all the three populations, parent–offspring regression revealed little or no evidence of heritable variation. Effects of common environment for siblings and variation in the host-plant quality between insect generations are likely to be the main factors explaining these differences. A consequence of such host-plant variation in the wild might be that genetic variation of such chemical defensive traits is largely invisible to natural selection.},

We examined L. hesperus egg distribution in individual strawberry plants and parasitism by A. iole of eggs in different strawberry plant structures to determine whether plant-related factors affected parasitoid performance in strawberries. L. hesperus laid more eggs (46.5\% of all eggs laid) in the fruit (between the achenes [seeds] in the fleshy receptacle) than in the petiole (23.3\%), leaflet (20.3\%), peduncle (6.2\%), or calyx (3.7\%). In a no-choice test, parasitism by A. iole was higher in the petiole (96.7\%), calyx (91.9\%), and leaflet (85.2\%) than in the fruit (51.8\%), in which the achenes appeared to hinder parasitoid access to host eggs. In addition, in young fruits in which the interachene distance was minimum, parasitism was considerably lower (25.4\%) than in fruits in which receptacle swelling had resulted in interachene distances that were medium (65.7\% parasitism) or large (77.1\% parasitism). Our results suggest that strawberry fruits can provide refugia from parasitism by A. iole and that maximum protection occurs when the achenes are contiguous. The presence of refugia in strawberries limits the impact of augmentative biological control with A. iole, highlighting the need for its integration with other strategies to effectively suppress L. hesperus in strawberries.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Moderate rates of herbivory can enhance primary production. This hypothesis has led to a controversy as to whether such positive effects can result in mutualistic interactions between plants and herbivores. We present a model for the ecology and evolution of plant‐herbivore systems to address this question. In this model, herbivores have a positive indirect effect on plants through recycling of a limiting nutrient. Plants can evolve but are constrained by a trade‐off between growth and antiherbivore defense. Although evolution generally does not lead to optimal plant performance, our evolutionary analysis shows that, under certain conditions, the plant‐herbivore interaction can be considered mutualistic. This requires in particular that herbivores efficiently recycle nutrients and that plant reproduction be positively correlated with primary production. We emphasize that two different definitions of mutualism need to be distinguished. A first ecological definition of mutualism is based on the short‐term response of plants to herbivore removal, whereas a second evolutionary definition rests on the long‐term response of plants to herbivore removal, allowing plants to adapt to the absence of herbivores. The conditions for an evolutionary mutualism are more stringent than those for an ecological mutualism. A particularly counterintuitive result is that higher herbivore recycling efficiency results both in increased plant benefits and in the evolution of increased plant defense. Thus, antagonistic evolution occurs within a mutualistic interaction.},

This study examined genetic variation among populations of the distylous temperate forest herb Pulmonaria officinalis located in the core, the edge, and outside the species’ main distribution range. • Methods: We compared patterns of genetic variation for eight microsatellite loci between disjunct (Belgium), edge (western Germany), and core (eastern Germany) populations of P. officinalis. • Key results: Disjunct populations contained only a subset of alleles found in edge and core populations and had significantly lower within-population genetic variation. No significant differences, however, in within-population genetic variation were found between edge and core populations, except for allelic and genotypic richness. Genetic differentiation was highest among disjunct (FST = 0.11) and lowest among core populations (FST = 0.03). Significant (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.01) isolation by distance was found for disjunct and edge populations (rM = 0.29 and 0.50, respectively), but not for core populations (rM = 0.18). • Conclusions: The results are best interpreted from a “dynamic range” point of view in which the observed low levels of genetic diversity and high genetic differentiation in disjunct populations are best explained through historical processes, most likely the introduction of the species in medieval times. Lower levels of gene flow caused by the pronounced fragmentation of forests in Belgium may further have contributed to the genetic structure of P. officinalis in these disjunct populations.},

	abstract = {A major challenge in ecology is to understand how the millions of species on Earth are organized into biological communities. Mechanisms promoting coexistence are one such class of organizing processes, which allow multiple species to persist in the same trophic level of a given web of species interactions. If some mechanism promotes the coexistence of two or more species, each species must be able to increase when it is rare and the others are at their typical abundances; this invasibility criterion is fundamental evidence for species coexistence regardless of the mechanism. In an attempt to evaluate the level of empirical support for coexistence mechanisms in nature, we surveyed the literature for empirical studies of coexistence at a local scale (i.e., species found living together in one place) to determine whether these studies satisfied the invasibility criterion. In our survey, only seven of 323 studies that drew conclusions about species coexistence evaluated invasibility in some way in either observational or experimental studies. In addition, only three other studies evaluated necessary but not sufficient conditions for invasibility (i.e., negative density dependence and a trade-off in performance that influences population regulation). These results indicate that, while species coexistence is a prevalent assumption for why species are able to live together in one place, critical empirical tests of this fundamental assumption of community structure are rarely performed. These tests are central to developing a more robust understanding of the relative contributions of both deterministic and stochastic processes structuring biological communities.},

	abstract = {* The Janzen–Connell hypothesis proposes that specialist natural enemies, such as herbivores and pathogens, maintain diversity in plant communities by reducing survival rates of conspecific seeds and seedlings located close to reproductive adults or in areas of high conspecific density. Variation in the strength of distance- and density-dependent effects is hypothesized to explain variation in plant species richness along climatic gradients, with effects predicted to be stronger in the tropics than the temperate zone and in wetter habitats compared to drier habitats. * We conducted a comprehensive literature search to identify peer-reviewed experimental studies published in the 40+ years since the hypothesis was first proposed. Using data from these studies, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the current weight of evidence for the distance and density predictions of the Janzen–Connell hypothesis. * Overall, we found significant support for both the distance- and density-dependent predictions. For all studies combined, survival rates were significantly reduced near conspecifics compared to far from conspecifics, and in areas with high densities of conspecifics compared to areas with low conspecific densities. There was no indication that these results were due to publication bias. * The strength of distance and density effects varied widely among studies. Contrary to expectations, this variation was unrelated to latitude, and there was no significant effect of study region. However, we did find a trend for stronger distance and density dependence in wetter sites compared to sites with lower annual precipitation. In addition, effects were significantly stronger at the seedling stage compared to the seed stage. * Synthesis. Our study provides support for the idea that distance- and density-dependent mortality occurs in plant communities world-wide. Available evidence suggests that natural enemies are frequently the cause of such patterns, consistent with the Janzen–Connell hypothesis, but additional studies are needed to rule out other mechanisms (e.g. intraspecific competition). With the widespread existence of density and distance dependence clearly established, future research should focus on assessing the degree to which these effects permit species coexistence and contribute to the maintenance of diversity in plant communities.},

	abstract = {Elemental hyperaccumulation may have several functions, including plant defense against natural enemies. A total of 34 studies, including 72 experimental tests, have been conducted to date. At least some tests have demonstrated defense by hyperaccumulated As, Cd, Ni, Se and Zn, but relatively few plant taxa and natural enemies have been investigated. Defense by hyperaccumulated Ni has been shown for most leaf/root chewing herbivores and pathogens tested (20 of 26 tests) but not for herbivores of other feeding modes (1 of 8 tests). Most tests (5 of 6) using Ni concentrations below accumulator levels found no defensive effect, and the single test using plants in the accumulator range also found no effect. For Zn, mixed results have been reported for both hyperaccumulator (3 of 6 tests showed defense) and accumulator levels (3 of 4 tests showed defense). These tests have focused exclusively on leaf chewing/scraping herbivores: no herbivores of other feeding modes, or pathogens, have been tested. Both hyperaccumulator and accumulator concentrations of Se generally have shown defensive effects (12 of 14 tests). Most (75\%) of these positive results used plants with accumulator Se concentrations. The three tests of Cd showed defensive effects in two cases, one for hyperaccumulator and one for sub-accumulator Cd concentrations. Arsenic has been tested only once, and was found effective against a leaf-chewing herbivore at a concentration much less than the hyperaccumulator level. Defense studies have used a variety of experimental approaches, including choice and no-choice experiments as well as experiments that use artificial diet or growth media. Investigations of hyperaccumulation as a defense against natural enemies have led to two emerging questions. First, what is the minimum concentration of an element sufficient for defense? Evidence suggests that plants other than hyperaccumulators (such as accumulators) may be defended by elements against some natural enemies. Second, do the effects of an element combine with the effects of organic defensive compounds in plants to produce enhanced joint defensive effects? Recent investigation of this “joint effects hypothesis,” using Ni and secondary plant compounds in artificial insect diet, has demonstrated joint effects. Initial answers to both these questions suggest that defensive effects of elements in plants are more widespread than previously believed. These results also suggest an evolutionary pathway by which elemental hyperaccumulation may have evolved from accumulation. In this “defensive enhancement” scenario, defensive benefits of elevated levels of elements may have led to stepwise increases in element concentrations that further magnified these benefits. This series of steps could have led to increased accumulation, and ultimately hyperaccumulation, of elements by plants.},

Each of the four primary mechanisms of switching identified by Murdoch et al. (1975) can be related to the components of prey risk, including the efficiency of the search path and the probability of detection. Models of frequency-dependent predation can be categorized as either mechanistic or descriptive. Two descriptive models have been proposed by Elton and Greenwood (1970) and by Manly (1973). In order to develop a more general model, I combined features of both earlier models. I then evaluated these three models in terms of their ability to fit both theoretical and empirical examples of switching. All the models fit the empirical data reasonably well, but the new model fits the theoretical case better than the other descriptive models do. One advantage of the new model is the greater insight it provides into the behavioral mechanisms underlying frequency-dependent predation.},

Thereby, plant responses to an early-season herbivore may have profound consequences for the amount and type of future attack.2. Here we studied the effect of early-season herbivory by caterpillars of Pieris rapae on the composition of the insect herbivore community on domesticated Brassica oleracea plants. We compared the effect of herbivory on two cultivars that differ in the degree of susceptibility to herbivores to analyse whether induced plant responses supersede differences caused by constitutive resistance.3. Early-season herbivory affected the herbivore community, having contrasting effects on different herbivore species, while these effects were similar on the two cultivars. Generalist insect herbivores avoided plants that had been induced, whereas these plants were colonised preferentially by specialist herbivores belonging to both leaf-chewing and sap-sucking guilds.4. Our results show that community-wide effects of early-season herbivory may prevail over effects of constitutive plant resistance. Induced responses triggered by prior herbivory may lead to an increase in susceptibility to the dominant specialists in the herbivorous insect community. The outcome of the balance between contrasting responses of herbivorous community members to induced plants therefore determines whether induced plant responses result in enhanced plant resistance.},

In the course of these investigations, the life-cycle of the beetle, as it occurs on watercress, has been followed out together with its hibernation habits and the duration of the various larval and pupal stages. A perusal of accounts of previous work on this beetle showed that only two generations of adults have been described, but in the present work it was found that actually there are three generations produced in the year.

All accessions were tested using a no-choice design in order to maximize feeding and oviposition. Resistance was evaluated by recording numbers of feeding/oviposition punctures, mines, pupae, and adults. Of these accessions, several appeared to have good-excellent leafminer resistance. Compared to all plants except the wild relatives, these plants had fewer feeding punctures and allowed significantly less survival during development. In order to document if the observed resistance was caused by the carcinogenic and mutagenic linear furanocoumarins, the amounts of psoralen, bergapten and xanthotoxin present in both leaves and petioles of each accession were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography. Results indicated that L. trifolii resistance was not due to these undesirable compounds, but some of the accessions were eliminated from further immediate consideration by unacceptably high concentrations.

Moreover, censuses may occur sporadically, and observation errors change with sample methods and effort. The state variable (usually density or abundance) may be hidden from view and known only through highly indirect observational schemes (such as public health records, hunting reports, or fossil/archeological surveys). We extend the basic state-space model for time-series analysis to accommodate these dominant sources of variability that influence population data. Using examples, we show how different types of process error and observation error, unequal sample intervals, and missing values can be accounted for within the flexible framework of Bayesian state-space models. We provide algorithms based on Gibbs sampling that can be used to obtain posterior estimates of population states and of model parameters. For models that can be linearized, results can be used for direct sampling of the posterior, including those with missing values and unequal sample intervals. For nonlinear models, we make use of Metropolis-Hastings within the Gibbs sampling framework. Examples derive from long-term census and population data. We illustrate the extension to discrete state variables with multiple stages using a Time-series Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (TSIR) model for mid 20th-century measles infection in London, where birth rates are assumed known, but susceptibles and infected individuals arise from imperfect reporting.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Free-ranging large grazers, such as cattle and horses, are increasingly reintroduced to former agricultural areas in Western Europe in order to restore natural and diverse habitats. In this review we outline mechanisms by which large grazers induce and maintain structural diversity in the vegetation (mosaics of grasslands, shrub thickets and trees). This variation in vegetation structure is considered to be important for the conservation of biodiversity of various plant and animal groups.The process of spatial association with unpalatable plants (as-sociational resistance) enables palatable plants to establish in grasslands maintained by large grazers. In this way, short unattractive (thorny, low quality or toxic) species facilitate taller unattractive shrubs, which facilitate palatable trees, which in turn outshade the species that facilitated their recruitment. Established trees can, therefore, not regenerate under their own canopy, leading to cyclic patch dynamics. Since this cyclic dynamic occurs on a local scale, this contributes to shifting mosaics. The mechanisms involved in creating and maintaining the resulting shifting mosaics are described for temperate flood-plain and heathland ecosystems, including the effects on nutrient transport within grazed landscapes. How grazing leads to shifting mosaics is described in terms of plant functional types, allowing potential generalisation to other ecosystems.The resulting interaction web of grasses, unpalatable forbs and shrubs, palatable light-demanding trees and shade-tolerant trees is discussed, and was found to contain various interesting direct and indirect effects. The key process contributing to spatial diversity in vegetation structure is the alternation of positive (facilitation) interactions between plant species at one life cycle stage, and competitive displacement at another stage. Grazing thus causes directional successional sequences to change to shifting mosaics. The implications of this theory for nature conservation are discussed, including the relevant management problems, possible choices and practical solutions.We conclude that the theoretical framework outlined in this review provides helpful insights when coping with nature conservation issues in temperate woodland habitats.},

	abstract = {Elucidating the factors influencing genetic differentiation is an important task in biology, and the relative contribution from natural selection and genetic drift has long been debated. In this study, we used a regression-based approach to simultaneously estimate the quantitative contributions of environmental adaptation and isolation by distance on genetic variation in Boechera stricta, a wild relative of Arabidopsis. Patterns of discrete and continuous genetic differentiation coexist within this species. For the discrete differentiation between two major genetic groups, environment has larger contribution than geography, and we also identified a significant environment-by-geography interaction effect. Elsewhere in the species range, we found a latitudinal cline of genetic variation reflecting only isolation by distance. To further confirm the effect of environmental selection on genetic divergence, we identified the specific environmental variables predicting local genotypes in allopatric and sympatric regions. Water availability was identified as the possible cause of differential local adaptation in both geographical regions, confirming the role of environmental adaptation in driving and maintaining genetic differentiation between the two major genetic groups. In addition, the environment-by-geography interaction is further confirmed by the finding that water availability is represented by different environmental factors in the allopatric and sympatric regions. In conclusion, this study shows that geographical and environmental factors together created stronger and more discrete genetic differentiation than isolation by distance alone, which only produced a gradual, clinal pattern of genetic variation. These findings emphasize the importance of environmental selection in shaping patterns of species-wide genetic variation in the natural environment.},

Wild-type EW load was more than 10-fold lower on leaves than on stems. Compared with the EW on wild-type stems, EW on wild-type leaves had a much higher proportion of their total EW load in the form of alkanes and 1-alcohols; a large reduction in secondary alcohols, ketones, and esters; and a chain-length distribution for major EW classes that was skewed toward longer lengths. The eceriferum (cer) mutations often differentially affected leaf and stem EW chemical compositions. For example, the cer2 mutant EW phenotype was expressed on the stem but not on the leaf. Compared to wild type, the amount of primary alcohols on cer9 mutants was reduced on leaves but elevated on stems, whereas an opposite differential effect for primary alcohols was observed on cer16 leaves and stems. Putative functions for CER gene products are discussed. The CER4 and CER6 gene products may be involved in fatty aldehyde reduction and C26 fatty acylcoenzyme A elongation, respectively. CER1, CER8, CER9, and CER16 gene products may be involved in EW substrate transfer. The CER3 gene product may be involved in release of fatty acids from elongase complexes. CER2 gene product may have regulatory functions.},

These species provide special opportunities to study the evolution of host range. Uroleucon ambrosiae aphids present an example. Most Uroleucon species are monophagous on particular host plants from the Asteraceae, and U. ambrosiae appears to specialize on the giant ragweed, Ambrosia trifida, in eastern North America. In the American Southwest, however, U. ambrosiae uses a variety of asteraceous taxa as hosts. For the present study, we assayed host-associated behaviors of U. ambrosiae from both eastern and southwestern regions of the United States on each of four asteraceous genera. Data from choice and no-choice experiments and electrical penetration graph analyses revealed highly significant differences in the acceptability of the four test plants. Plant taxa were ranked in the same order across multiple behavioral assays by aphids from both regions. However, eastern and southwestern aphids exhibited significantly different patterns of behavior. Ambrosia was the most highly accepted plant by aphids from both regions, but southwestern aphids accepted the other test plants more readily than did eastern aphids, indicating geographic variation in degree of host specificity. This regional differentiation held for aphids reared under controlled conditions for the EPG studies, indicating a genetic basis for population divergence in U. ambrosiae host-use traits. We speculate that the generalism within U. ambrosiae is an evolutionarily derived trait and represents an ecological adaptation to the scattered and unpredictable distribution of the preferred A. trifida host in the arid American Southwest.},

	abstract = {Background: Feeding habits and dietary nutritional content may play a key role in pathogen-dependent foraging ecology, because mounting an effective immune response is costly for the host. Hypothesis: Since immune defence is the final line of protection against infective aggression, an adequate provision of dietary macromolecules through a selective foraging behaviour is required to maintain immunocompetence in infected hosts. Goal: We studied dietary switching and its consequences on immune response performance after an immune challenge using mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) as a model host. Methods: We evaluated diet selection and body mass balance (proxy of fitness) of larvae following a lipopolysaccharide challenge under three experimental nutritional treatments: an isocaloric low-protein/high-carbohydrate or high-protein/low-carbohydrate diet offered either independently (no-choice experiment) or simultaneously (dual-choice experiment). Furthermore, we studied the effect of diet composition on three immune traits: antibacterial activity, phenoloxidase activity, and total haemocyte count. Results: Immune-challenged larvae ate almost five times more than did control larvae in the dual-choice experiment. In addition, 50.7\% of total food intake by immune-challenged larvae corresponded to the high-protein/low-carbohydrate diet, significantly higher than challenged or unchallenged control larvae (3.7\% and 2.3\% respectively). However, no significant differences in body mass change were observed. In contrast, in the no-choice diet condition, immune-challenged larvae lost body mass compared with naive mealworms. Furthermore, we found that dietary protein had a positive effect on antibacterial activity and total haemocyte count but not phenoloxidase activity, and that mealworms feeding on a balanced diet did not have a better immune performance. Conclusions: The immune response activation triggers a compensatory shift in host foraging behaviour that is not necessarily associated with the prevailing physiological state, but can have considerable influence on Darwinian fitness.},

In piedmont North Carolina the solitary bee and fly pollinators of this species are also frequent visitors to Claytonia virginica. Removals of nearby flowers of C. virginica increased seed set of S. pubera. Examination of seed set in populations of potted plants indicated that the effect was due to change in species composition rather than plant density. Variation in seed production was high, however, and even when flowers were provided with excess pollen through supplemental hand pollinations, only 20\% of ovules produced seeds. Competition for pollination appears to be one of several selective forces that act on blooming time of S. pubera. Stellaria pubera blooms slightly later than C. virginica. Whereas the seeds set of early flowers was increased 13\% by removal of C. virginica and 19\% by hand pollination, seed set of late flowers was unaffected. Plants forced to bloom early also tended to be more pollinator-limited than control plants. Removal of C. virginica did not, however, increase the seed set of S. pubera plants forced to bloom early significantly more than that of control plants. Other forces are probably also involved in the maintenance of blooming time.},

With small differences in tannic acid concentration, the ratio of the consumption per lowand high-tannin bowl was independent of frequency of occurrence, but with large differences in tannic acid concentration, we found frequency-dependent food choice. The deer ate proportionally less from high-tannin bowls if these occurred at low relative frequency. Variation between frequency treatments in the average order of encounter of bowl types might have produced this effect, because we found that the deer left a high-tannin bowl more quickly if they had switched to it from a low-tannin bowl. We argue that the perceived contrast between the tastes of different food types can play a role for food choice by mammalian herbivores.},

	abstract = {Diverse life forms have evolved internal clocks enabling them to monitor time and thereby anticipate the daily environmental changes caused by Earth's rotation. The plant circadian clock regulates expression of about one-third of the Arabidopsis genome, yet the physiological relevance of this regulation is not fully understood. Here we show that the circadian clock, acting with hormone signals, provides selective advantage to plants through anticipation of and enhanced defense against herbivory. We found that cabbage loopers (Trichoplusia ni) display rhythmic feeding behavior that is sustained under constant conditions, and plants entrained in light/dark cycles coincident with the entrainment of the T. ni suffer only moderate tissue loss due to herbivory. In contrast, plants entrained out-of-phase relative to the insects are significantly more susceptible to attack. The in-phase entrainment advantage is lost in plants with arrhythmic clocks or deficient in jasmonate hormone; thus, both the circadian clock and jasmonates are required. Circadian jasmonate accumulation occurs in a phase pattern consistent with preparation for the onset of peak circadian insect feeding behavior, providing evidence for the underlying mechanism of clock-enhanced herbivory resistance. Furthermore, we find that salicylate, a hormone involved in biotrophic defense that often acts antagonistically to jasmonates, accumulates in opposite phase to jasmonates. Our results demonstrate that the plant circadian clock provides a strong physiological advantage by performing a critical role in Arabidopsis defense.},

Recently, it has been emphasized that phenotypic plasticity, such as induced plant responses, has the potential to lead to evolutionary changes of interacting partners. Here, we report that induced plant regrowth promotes a locally adaptive feeding preference of a leaf beetle, Plagiodera versicolora. We found that there was among-population variation in the strength of the feeding preference of the leaf beetle for leaf-age types of conspecific host plants. The strength of the preference was positively correlated to leaf production of host plants across populations, and the intensity of induced regrowth was likely to have been responsible for geographic variation in new leaf production. Within one population, we detected a significant additive genetic variance and heritability in the preference for consuming new vs. old leaves. Moreover, the strength of preference was significantly related to egg production depending on the leaf-age types. Thus, allopatric populations can evolutionarily develop different adaptive preference, according to locally distinct patterns of induced host regrowth.},

Sixteen of 17 species belonging to three orders consume significantly less food when treated with the extract. The bioactivity of the isolated active compound meliartenin and its interchangeable isomer 12-hydroxiamoorastatin (1) was further studied. In choice tests, compound 1 inhibited feeding of Epilachna paenulata Germ.

	abstract = {Both an individual's genotype and environment govern its phenotype, and this phenotype may have extended consequences for species interactions and communities. We examined the importance of plant genotype and environmental factors operating at large (habitat) and small (microhabitat) spatial scales in affecting a multitrophic arthropod community on plants. We planted 926 plants from 14 genotypes of Oenothera biennis into five natural habitats that represent the range of environments in which this plant locally occurs. Genotypic differences among plants accounted for as much as 41\% of the variation in arthropod diversity (Simpson's diversity index) and also affected arthropod evenness, richness, abundance, and biomass on individual plants. However, the effects of particular plant genotypes on the arthropod community varied across habitats (i.e., there were significant plant genotype-by-habitat interactions). Plant genotype explained more variation in the arthropod community than did environmental variation among microhabitats, but less variation than habitats, as predicted by the scale-dependent hypothesis. Herbivores and omnivores were more strongly affected by plant genetic variation than predators, consistent with the notion that phytophagous insects undergo stronger reciprocal interactions with plants than do predators. We detected heritable variation in arthropod community variables and the ability for the herbivore community to select on plant traits, suggesting that evolution in O. biennis can lead to changes in the arthropod community. Genetic variation in plant size, architecture, and reproductive phenology were the plant traits most strongly correlated with arthropod community variables. Our results demonstrate that genotype-by-environment interactions are a major determinant of arthropod community structure.},

These plants produce and store blends of amino acid-derived secondary metabolites called glucosinolates. Upon tissue rupture by natural enemies, the myrosinase enzyme hydrolyses glucosinolates, releasing defense molecules. Brassicaceae display extensive variation in the mixture of glucosinolates that they produce. To investigate the genetics underlying natural variation in glucosinolate profiles, we conducted a large genome-wide association study of 22 methionine-derived glucosinolates using A. thaliana accessions from across Europe. We found that 36\% of among accession variation in overall glucosinolate profile was explained by genetic differentiation at only three known loci from the glucosinolate pathway.

We detected a significant contribution of glucosinolate loci toward general herbivore resistance and lifetime fitness in common garden experiments conducted in France, where accessions are enriched in hydroxyalkenyls. In addition to demonstrating the adaptive value of glucosinolate profile variation, we also detected long-distance linkage disequilibrium at two underlying loci, GS-OH and GS-ELONG. Locally cooccurring alleles at these loci display epistatic effects on herbivore resistance and fitness in ecologically realistic conditions. Together, our results suggest that natural selection has favored a locally adaptive configuration of physically unlinked loci in Western Europe.},

In a field experiment, we examined the effects of resemblance between male and female flowers on pollinator behavior and the amount of geitonogamous pollination. When the same numbers of female and male flowers were presented in an artificial floral array, solitary bees tended to visit female flowers first and then visit male flowers in a foraging sequence. However, when sepals of male flowers were glued to female flowers from which the original sepals had been removed to produce floral monomorphism, solitary bees frequently moved from male to female flowers. Consequently, the amount of pollen deposited on stigmas per array visit was increased. The results show that floral monomorphism increases geitonogamous pollination, and \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{female\}{\textbackslash}textbackslash,\&gt; {\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{male\}{\textbackslash}textbackslash,\$ flower‐size dimorphism in A. quinata can avoid geitonogamous pollination. We discuss the effect of pollinator selectivity on the evolution of flower‐size dimorphism and intersexual floral mimicry.},

In order to analyze the effects of four such highly inducible genes of Populus, two genes encoding trypsin inhibitors (PtdKTI5 from hybrid poplar, Populus trichocarpa × P. deltoides and PtKTI2 from trembling aspen, Populus tremuloides Michx.), a wound-inducible gene (PtdKTI5 from hybrid poplar, Populus trichocarpa × P. deltoids) and a stress-responsive gene (PtdPOP3 from hybrid poplar, Populus trichocarpa × P. deltoids), we have produced transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana expressing these genes individually under the control of the CaMV35S promoter by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Stable integration and high transcriptional levels of the target cDNAs and their inheritance in transgenic Arabidopsis lines were confirmed by genomic PCR, quantitative PCR and T3 progeny segregation analysis. In the no-choice bioassays, all the four types of transgenic Arabidopsis confer different levels of insect resistance against Plutella xylostella L. larvae at various stages and the PtdKTI5 overexpressing plants turned out to be most effective. Our data indicated that these four Populus defense-related genes under investigation could be potentially exploited for the protection against P. xylostella L. in transgenic plants.},

The degree to which population structure of allozyme variation reflects that of quantitative traits, however, is not well resolved. Here, we compare estimates of population differentiation (FST) of 11 populations for allozymes with those for nine discrete and nine continuous morphological traits. Overall, the allozymes have the lowest FST estimates, indicating relatively little population differentiation. Excepting two traits, petal width and long internode length, the continuous morphological traits have estimates similar to those from allozymes. The discrete morphological traits tend to have the highest estimates. On a single trait basis, estimates of FST for four discrete and two continuous traits are higher than those for allozymes. A more detailed (narrow-sense quantitative) genetic study of two populations suggests that these estimates of FST may underestimate the true value because of dominance. Clustering analyses show that the pattern of differentiation for the discrete morphological traits strongly reflects the geographical distribution of the populations, whereas the patterns for the continuous traits and allozymes do not. These results suggest that selection has been occurring on the discrete morphological traits, selecting toward a common optimum within each geographic group, and optima differing among geographic groups.},

Availability of alternative foods increased the persistence of the aversion to the CA-flavored test diet. Furthermore, persistence was related to the energy content of the alternative. The higher energy alternative better complimented the high protein content of the basal ration (alfalfa pellets) and increased persistence versus the lower energy alternative. Continued avoidance of the CA-flavored test diet was observed even after a 68-day intermission among lambs with access to alternatives.

	abstract = {During recent decades, many species have responded to global warming by poleward range expansions. We require a better mechanistic understanding of the nature and extent of such processes to assess how climate change might affect biodiversity. Wing-dimorphic bush-crickets are excellent objects to study dispersal and colonization processes at the range margin because the long-winged morphs (macropters) represent dispersal units of otherwise flightless species. Moreover, these insects produce noisy songs and can easily be mapped. The present study comprised a detailed investigation of the population dynamics and genetics at the edge of the range of Roesel's bush-cricket, Metrioptera roeselii. We mapped the distribution of this insect in a previously unoccupied area of 185 km2 and examined the genetic structure at the range margin using four polymorphic microsatellite loci. The results obtained demonstrate that the European heat wave in 2003 induced a strong immigration of macropters in the area stemming from multiple sources, whereas only few immigrants were recorded in the two subsequent years. Macropters were genotyped in a distance of up to 19.1 km from their origin, considerably exceeding the known dispersal distances for this species. Moreover, the data show that strong local founder effects are equalized on a large scale by the high number of immigrants from multiple sources. The present study demonstrates that macropters are of high significance for the range expansion of wing-dimorphic insects because a single-year climatic anomaly can induce strong dispersal processes. © 2009 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2009, 97, 118–127.},

A year-long study was conducted on the population dynamics of this mosquito using oviposition traps in Okinawa, Japan. Time series analysis and the Ricker population model were used to analyze the association between mosquito density and population growth and fluctuations in relative humidity, temperature, and rainfall. Our results suggest that Ur. novobscura ryukyuana has stable denso-dependent dynamics, which are autonomous from weather fluctuations. Our results were opposite to patterns observed in other subtropical mosquito species, whose population dynamics might be partially driven by weather fluctuations, thus highlighting the diversity of responses that mosquitoes can have to changing environments.},

Moreover, this study shows that this induction can be maternally transmitted, increasing trichome density in progeny before they experience herbivory. This transgenerational response must involve a yet undescribed epigenetic mechanism. These experiments also show genetic variation among plants in the capacity for both within and between plant generation induction. Despite the clear evolutionary importance of variation in constitutive and induced herbivory-resistance traits, few other studies have noted genetic variation in both within a plant species.},

Half of each sample was subjected to a simulated autumn drought treatment while the other half received a continuous water supply (in both cases under controlled conditions). All germinations and deaths were recorded throughout the 2-month experimental period. 3 Only five species had significantly different numbers of germinations between the two watering treatments, and in four of these germination was lower in the drought-simulated treatment. Re-watering of samples from this treatment did not result in a second wave of germination. 4 Drought-induced mortality was greater in the samples with high seedling densities. A significant negative correlation was evident between seedling density and the water content of the pots at the end of the experimental drought. 5 The least drought-sensitive species were those with stem or leaf hairs and those belonging to Crassulaceae, which show a particular adaptive metabolism.},

	abstract = {In this study we present a simple optimization model for the evolution of defensive strategies (tolerance and resistance) of plants against their natural enemies. The model specifically evaluates the consequences of introducing variable costs and benefits of tolerance and resistance and nonlinear cost-and-benefit functions for tolerance and resistance. Incorporating these assumptions, the present model of plant defense predicts different evolutionary scenarios, not expected by previous work. Basically, the presence of an adaptive peak corresponding to intermediate levels of allocation to tolerance and resistance can arise when the shape parameter of the cost function is higher than the corresponding of the benefit function. The presence of two alternatives peaks of maximum tolerance and maximum resistance occurs only when benefits of tolerance and resistance interact less than additive. Finally, the presence of one peak of maximum resistance or maximum tolerance depends on the relative values of the magnitude of costs for tolerance and resistance. An important outcome of our model is that under a plausible set of conditions, variable costs of tolerance and resistance can represent an important aspect involved in the maintenance of intermediate levels of tolerance and resistance, and in favoring adaptive divergence in plant defensive strategies among populations. The model offers a framework for future theoretical and empirical work toward understanding spatial variation in levels of allocation to different defensive strategies.},

Two phenotypes of Geum rossii occur along a gradient of disturbance, with ‘tight’ competitive cushions in stable conditions and ‘loose’ facilitative cushions in disturbed conditions. A common-garden study suggested that field-based traits may have a genetic basis. Field experiments showed that the reproductive fitness of G. rossii cushions decreased with increasing facilitation. Finally, using a dual-lattice model we showed that including the cost and benefit of facilitation may contribute to the co-occurrence of genotypes with contrasting facilitative effects. Our results indicate that changes in community composition due to phenotypic differences in facilitative effects of a foundation species may in turn affect selective pressures on the foundation species.},

We examined host preferences, degree of differentiation in mate choice, and divergence in cuticular morphology using near-infrared spectroscopy in the grasshopper Hesperotettix viridis aiming to understand lineage divergence. In Kansas (USA), H. viridis is an oligophagous species feeding on Gutierrezia and Solidago host species. To identify incipient mechanisms of lineage divergence and isolation, we compared host choice, mate choice, and phenotypic divergence among natural grasshopper populations in zones of contact with populations encountering only one of the host species. A significant host-based preference from the two host groups was detected in host-paired feeding preference studies. No-choice mate selection experiments revealed a preference for individuals collected from the same host species independent of geographic location, and little mating was observed between individuals collected from different host species. Female mate choice tests between males from the two host species resulted in 100\% fidelity with respect to host use. Significant differentiation in colour and cuticular composition of individuals from different host plants was observed, which correlated positively with host choice and mate choice. No evidence for reinforcement in the zone of contact was detected, suggesting that divergent selection for host plant use promotes sexual isolation in this species. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2010, 100, 866–878.},

	abstract = {1. The genus Prosopis consists of woody leguminous trees and shrubs of interest for fuelwood and agroforestry purposes in arid and semi-arid regions. Prosopis velutina is common to the south-western United States and northern Mexico. Its flowers are an important food source for several native insects, as well as Apis mellifera used in the honey industry. This paper examines plant-pollinator interactions, and provides the first quantification of pollination effectiveness and pollination efficiency of several groups of insects that forage on P. velutina in the Sonoran Desert near Tucson, Arizona. 2. Pollination effectiveness is defined as a measure of an insect's potential as a pollen vector, as reflected by its ability to effect fruit production significantly. Pollination effectiveness of small insects, determined by covering inflorescences with mesh bags with 3 mm pore size, was equal to that on completely open-pollinated inflorescences. Pollination effectiveness of nocturnal insects, determined by exposing inflorescences to visitation only at night, was nonsignificant. However, actual activity of nocturnal insects was not monitored. 3. Pollination efficiency is defined as the relative ability of an insect to pollinate flowers effectively, as measured by fruit production per some unit of measure (i.e. per visit). Three measures of pollination efficiency based on pod production per visit (Spears' PE), per minute on the inflorescence (PEt), and per unit of distance traversed on the inflorescence (PEd), were determined for A. mellifera, Chalicodoma spp., Colletidae, Perdita spp. and Volucella spp. Chalicodoma spp. were most efficient according to Spears' PE and PEt. Perdita spp. and Volucella spp. were equally as efficient as A. mellifera. Colletidae had the lowest values for all three measures of PE. The results are discussed in regard to interactions between floral development and insect behaviour. 4. When considering the number of visits required by a particular insect to effect pod production equal to that of open-pollinated inflorescences, native Chalicodoma spp., Perdita spp. and Volucella spp. were more efficient than the introduced A. mellifera. 5. Implications of the results with regard to conservation of biological diversity in natural ecosystems, and utilization of insects in pod or seed production orchards, are discussed.},

	abstract = {* 1We studied the metapopulation dynamics and persistence of an extinction-prone predator–prey interaction. We show that the dynamics of the system are influenced by both stochastic and deterministic processes. * 2Using host–parasitoid metapopulation data, we develop appropriate descriptors of the local within-patch population dynamics. In particular, we show that the local dynamics are well described by a Markov chain. We show that the local dynamics are determined predominately by demographic stochastic processes and that the deterministic signal is relatively weak. * 3To test the hypothesis that the persistence of predator–prey metapopulations is affected by habitat size, local population dynamics and different types of (demographic or environmental) stochasticity, we fit population models to the regional metapopulation time-series. Contrary to expectations this demographic noise is, however, undetectable at the regional scale and is masked by an environmental noise process. We show that by linking patches together, the predicted environmental noise is effectively decreased as metapopulation size increases. * 4Using a simple spatial stochastic model, we illustrate that the effects of demographic noise are masked rapidly at the regional scale due to the statistical effects of the central limit theorem. We discuss the implications of this for understanding the dynamics and persistence of metapopulations.},

Univariate and multivariate analyses of population data obtained from fresh material collected in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic indicated that three a priori groups (Puerto Rican spring- and fall-flowering populations, and Hispaniolan spring-flowering) are slightly different but considerable univariate overlap occurs in all characteristics measured, especially between the two phenological types in Puerto Rico. Among the flowering types, sympatric populations are either not different or are similar morphologically than pairs of allopatric populations. Similar analyses of herbaruim specimens, including type material, revealed that T. leiboldii, a species often confused with T. variegata, is restricted to Cuba, and is distinguished by having obovate instead of pandurate petals. Furthermore, spring- and fall-flowering T. variegata are more similar to each other within islands than among islands. Phenological and geographical groups are slightly different but the similarities among them are outstanding. Thus the Cuban, Hispaniolan, Puerto Rican, and Virgin Island populations of both phenological types represent a single species, T. variegata. Although some characteristics are plastic, especially vegetative features, the origin and maintenance of extraordinary levels of variation in T. variegata may involve hybridization, founder effects, and frequency dependent selection.},

Many invasive weeds, however, eventually encounter their native, coevolved enemies in areas of introduction.

Plants collected before the introduction of webworms in North America and during the earliest stages of establishment (1850–1889) are lower in toxic furanocoumarins than all plants subsequently collected in North America and lower than European plant samples collected before 1889. Thus, introduction of a major specialist herbivore can increase noxiousness of a species in its area of introduction, illuminating a potential consequence of classical biocontrol programs involving insect herbivores and poisonous weeds.},

	abstract = {Although FST is widely used as a measure of population structure, it has been criticized recently because of its dependency on within-population diversity. This dependency can lead to difficulties in interpretation and in the comparison of estimates among species or among loci and has led to the development of two replacement statistics, F′ST and D. F′ST is the normal FST standardized by the maximum value it can obtain, given the observed within-population diversity. D uses a multiplicative partitioning of diversity, based on the effective number of alleles rather than on the expected heterozygosity. In this study, we review the relationships between the three classes of statistics (FST, F′ST and D), their estimation and their properties. We illustrate the relationships between the statistics using a data set of estimates from 84 species taken from the last 4 years of Molecular Ecology. As with FST, unbiased estimators are available for the two new statistics D and F′ST. Here, we develop a new unbiased F′ST estimator based on GST, which we call G′′ST. However, F′ST can be calculated using any FST estimator for which the maximum value can be obtained. As all three statistics have their advantages and their drawbacks, we recommend continued use of FST in combination with either F′ST or D. In most cases, F′ST would be the best choice among the latter two as it is most suited for inferences of the influence of demographic processes such as genetic drift and migration on genetic population structure.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Apostatic (frequency‐ or density‐dependent) selection, aposematic signals, and mate choice behavior generally require that the mean prey or potential mate density m value be high enough (above a threshold T) to result in sufficient encounter rates for the searcher to learn or retain the association between conspicuous signals and prey unprofitability, to forage apostatically, or to choose among mates. This assumes that all searchers experience \$m\&gt; T\$ , which implicitly assumes an even dispersion of targets among searcher territories. Uneven dispersion generates new phenomena. If \$m\&lt; T\$ , then only territories with local density x values that are greater than T favor experience‐based behavior, leading to spatially variable frequency‐ or density‐dependent selection intensity. As aggregation increases, the increase in percentage of targets in favorable territories ( \$x\&gt; T\$ ) is greater than the increase in the percentage of territories that are favorable. The relationship is reversed when \$m\&gt; T\$ . In both cases, because as few as 10\% of the territories can contain 80\% of the targets, only a few territory holders may account for most of the selection on most of the target population; accidents of experience in only a few searchers can have unexpectedly large effects on the target population. This also provides an explanation for high searcher behavior variation (personalities): individuals from favorable territories will behave differently in behavioral experiments than those from unfavorable territories, at least with respect to similar kinds of targets. These effects will generate spatial heterogeneity in natural and sexual selection in what are otherwise uniform environments.},

Seed number per ramet (Ns) was weakly correlated to average seed weight (Wa, r2 = 0.36) and to vegetative ramet weight (Wv, r2 = 0.38), but a combination of these two variables accounted for 81\% of the variance in seed number. The allometric equation was Ns = 1.4 Wv 0.93Wa -0.78. The main source of variation was interspecific. The nonphylogenetic categorical variables accounted for little of the residual variance, with occurrence in disturbed habitats being the most important. This indicates that most of the variation in seed output among plants of different habitats or successional status is due to size-related effects.},

The petunia flowers studied contained a star pattern, with colored and white sectors. CEW larvae ate significantly less colored sectors than white sectors in no-choice bioassays in most cases. All CEW larvae feeding on blue sectors weighed significantly less after 2 days than larvae feeding on white sectors, which was negatively correlated with total anthocyanin levels. CL larvae ate less of blue sectors than white sectors, and blue sectors from one petunia cultivar caused significantly higher CL mortality than white sectors. Partially purified anthocyanin mixtures isolated from petunia flowers, when added to insect diet discs at approximately natural concentrations, reduced both CEW and CL larva weights compared to the controls. These studies demonstrate that the colored sectors of these petunia cultivars slow the development of these lepidopteran larvae and indicate that anthocyanins play some part in flower defense in petunia.},

We report on studies of the common milkweed Asclepias syriaca, which was introduced from North America to Europe over the past 400 years and which lacks most of its specialized herbivores in the introduced range. Using 10 populations from each continent grown in a common environment, we identified several growth and defense traits that have diverged, despite low neutral genetic differentiation between continents. We next developed a Bayesian modeling approach to account for relationships between molecular and phenotypic differences, confirming that continental trait differentiation was greater than expected from neutral genetic differentiation. We found evidence that growth-related traits adaptively diverged within and between continents. Inducible defenses triggered by monarch butterfly herbivory were substantially reduced in European populations, and this reduction in inducibility was concordant with altered phytohormonal dynamics, reduced plant growth, and a trade-off with constitutive investment. Freedom from the community of native and specialized herbivores may have favored constitutive over induced defense. Our replicated analysis of plant growth and defense, including phenotypically plastic traits, suggests adaptive evolution following a continental introduction.},

	abstract = {Abstract According to the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution, selection intensity in interactions varies across a landscape, forming a selection mosaic; interaction traits match at coevolutionary hotspots where selection is reciprocal and mismatch at coldspots where reciprocity is not a factor. Chemical traits play an important role in the interaction between wild parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) and the parsnip webworm (Depressaria pastinacella). Furanocoumarins, produced as plant defenses, are detoxified by the webworms by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases; significant additive genetic variation exists for both furanocoumarin production in the plant and detoxification in the insect, making these traits available for selection. To test the hypothesis that differences in selection intensity affect the distribution of coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots in this interaction, we examined 20 populations of webworms and wild parsnips in Illinois and Wisconsin that varied in size, extent of infestation, proximity to woods (and potential vertebrate predators), and proximity to a chemically distinct alternate host plant, Heracleum lanatum (cow parsnip). Twelve of 20 populations displayed phenotype matching between plant defense and insect detoxification profiles. Of the eight mismatched populations, a logistic regression model related matching probability to two predictors: the presence of the alternate host and average content of xanthotoxin (one of the five furanocoumarins produced by P. sativa). The odds of mismatching were significantly increased by the presence of the alternate host (odds ratio = 15.4) and by increased xanthotoxin content (odds ratio = 6.053). Parsnips growing near cow parsnip displayed chemical phenotypes that were chemically intermediate between cow parsnip and parsnips growing in isolation. Rapid phenotype matching in this system is likely due in part to differential mortality every season; larvae transferred to a plant 30 m or more from the plant on which they developed tended to experience increased mortality over larvae transferred to another umbel on the same plant on which they had developed, and plant populations that mismatched in 2001 displayed a change in chemical phenotype distribution from the previous year. Trait mixing through gene flow is also a likely factor in determining mismatch frequency. Populations from which webworms were eradicated the previous year were all recolonized; in three of seven of these populations, infestation rates exceeded 90\%. Our findings, consistent with the geographic mosaic theory, suggest that the presence of a chemically distinct alternate host plant can affect selection intensity in such a way as to reduce the likelihood of reciprocity in the coevolutionary interaction between wild parsnip and the parsnip webworm.},

However, it is difficult to separate these factors and detect the effects of selection when two or more contrasting selective factors are simultaneously acting on a single locus. In the damselfly Ischnura senegalensis, females exhibit color dimorphism and morph frequencies change geographically. We here evaluated the role of selection and stochastic factors in population divergence of morph frequencies by comparing the divergences in color locus and neutral loci. Comparisons between population pairwise FST for neutral loci and for the color locus did not detect any stochastic factors affecting color locus. Although comparison between population divergence in color and neutral loci using all populations detected only divergent selection, we detected two antagonistic selective factors acting on the color locus, that is, balancing and divergent selection, when considering geographical distance between populations. Our results suggest that a combination of two antagonistic selective factors, rather than stochastic factors, establishes the geographic cline in morph frequency in this system.},

To address these issues, we established eight replicate populations of native common evening primrose (Oenothera biennis). Each population was planted with 18 genotypes in identical frequency. By tracking genotype frequencies with microsatellite DNA markers over the subsequent three years (up to three generations, ≈5,000 genotyped plants), we show rapid and consistent evolution of two heritable plant life-history traits (shorter life span and later flowering time). This rapid evolution was only partially the result of differential seed production; genotypic variation in seed germination also contributed to the observed evolutionary response. Since evening primrose genotypes exhibited heritable variation for resistance to insect herbivores, which was related to flowering time, we predicted that evolutionary changes in genotype frequencies would feed back to influence populations of a seed predator moth that specializes on O. biennis. By the conclusion of the experiment, variation in the genotypic composition among our eight replicate field populations was highly predictive of moth abundance. These results demonstrate how rapid evolution in field populations of a native plant can influence ecological interactions.},

	abstract = {This review examines the direct effects of climate change on insect herbivores. Temperature is identified as the dominant abiotic factor directly affecting herbivorous insects. There is little evidence of any direct effects of CO2 or UVB. Direct impacts of precipitation have been largely neglected in current research on climate change. Temperature directly affects development, survival, range and abundance. Species with a large geographical range will tend to be less affected. The main effect of temperature in temperate regions is to influence winter survival; at more northerly latitudes, higher temperatures extend the summer season, increasing the available thermal budget for growth and reproduction. Photoperiod is the dominant cue for the seasonal synchrony of temperate insects, but their thermal requirements may differ at different times of year. Interactions between photoperiod and temperature determine phenology; the two factors do not necessarily operate in tandem. Insect herbivores show a number of distinct life-history strategies to exploit plants with different growth forms and strategies, which will be differentially affected by climate warming. There are still many challenges facing biologists in predicting and monitoring the impacts of climate change. Future research needs to consider insect herbivore phenotypic and genotypic flexibility, their responses to global change parameters operating in concert, and awareness that some patterns may only become apparent in the longer term.},

The major phenolic glucosides in the natural host were salicortin and tremulacin, which were also the major components in the Finnish S. purpurea and S. rosmarinifolia. The natural host, S. lasiolepis, was chosen over six Finnish willow species in multiple-choice tests. Multiple-choice tests with six Finnish willow species and one Finnish popular species showed that S. rosmarinifolia was significantly more attractive than any of the other species by at least 16-fold. No-choice testing with phenolic glucosides showed the tremulacin fraction to be the significant ovipositional stimulant, which elicited probes with the ovipositor at least 19 times more frequently than other glucosides. A tremulacin fraction at 1.5\% elicited significantly more probes than a tremulacin fraction tested at 0.4\%. In addition, tremulacin was the only glucoside to induce prolonged and repeated probing with the ovipositor, lasting a mean of 6.4 sec per bout per female. Only single probes lasting a fraction of a second were observed in response to other glucosides. This is the second study showing a direct effect of a phenolic glucoside as an ovipositional stimulant for a sawfly, and it also suggests the existence of a mechanism that enables females to respond positively in a graded way to shoot length heterogeneity in host plants and populations.},

	abstract = {• Background and Aims It is well known that plant aerial development is affected by light intensity in terms of the date of flowering, the length of stems and petioles, and the final individual leaf area. The aim of the work presented here was to analyse how shade-induced changes in leaf development occur on a dynamic basis from the whole rosette level to that of the cells.• Methods Care was taken to ensure that light intensity was the only source of micro-meteorological variation in the study. The dynamics of leaf production, rosette expansion, individual leaf area expansion and epidermal cell expansion were analysed in Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown under two light intensities in three independent experiments.• Key Results The total area of rosette leaves was reduced by the shading treatment. Both the number of leaves produced and their individual leaf areas were reduced. The reduction in leaf number was associated with a reduction in leaf initiation rate and the duration of the phase of leaf production. The reduction in individual leaf area was associated with a reduction in leaf expansion rate and an increase in the duration of leaf expansion. The changes in leaf expansion dynamics were accompanied by a decrease in epidermal cell number which was partly compensated for by an increase in epidermal cell area. Overall, the whole rosette leaf expansion rate was reduced by shading, whereas the total duration of rosette leaf expansion was unaffected. This was mainly due to the accumulation of the increases in the durations of expansion of each individual leaf which was associated with an increase in cell expansion.• Conclusions The dynamic analysis presented here reveals a new shade-adaptative response mediated via the control of area expansion at the cell, organ and whole plant levels.},

	abstract = {To understand how genetic architecture translates between phenotypic levels, we mapped the genetic architecture of growth and defense within the Arabidopsis thaliana Kas × Tsu recombinant inbred line population. We measured plant growth using traditional size measurements and size-corrected growth rates. This population contains genetic variation in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes, allowing us to separate their contributions. The cytoplasmic genome regulated a significant variance in growth but not defense, which was due to cytonuclear epistasis. Furthermore, growth adhered to an infinitesimal model of genetic architecture, while defense metabolism was more of a moderate-effect model. We found a lack of concordance between quantitative trait loci (QTL) regulating defense and those regulating growth. Given the published evidence proving the link between glucosinolates and growth, this is likely a false negative result caused by the limited population size. This size limitation creates an inability to test the entire potential genetic landscape possible between these two parents. We uncovered a significant effect of glucosinolates on growth once we accounted for allelic differences in growth QTLs. Therefore, other growth QTLs can mask the effects of defense upon growth. Investigating direct links across phenotypic hierarchies is fraught with difficulty; we identify issues complicating this analysis.},

The monophagous species is stimulated to bite by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a compound that is characteristic of the host plant and that may comprise up to 10\% of the dry weight of the leaf. Host specificity ofB. argentatus is enhanced by deterrent responses to compounds present in the surface waxes of all non-host-plant species.

Their association withLarrea is probably based on tolerance of the plant chemicals rather than on dependence on specific chemicals.

The data were analysed according to three criteria: yearly replications of the same study were considered independent data so that research repeated over time would have greater weight; a second meta-analysis was conducted with results of only 1 year because of possible lack of independence between results of the same study; the third approach was to remove studies involving Brassica spp. from the analysis because they are redundant from the standpoint of testing a general hypothesis of crop diversification. * 3The three analyses resulted in effect sizes of 0.50, 0.35 and 0.27, respectively, and all were statistically significant.

Recent work has shown that the ecological effects of multispecies interactions are often not predictable from studies of the component pairwise interactions. Little is known about how multispecies interactions affect the evolution of ecologically important traits. We tested the direct and interactive effects of inter‐ and intraspecific competition, as well as of two abundant herbivore species (a generalist folivore and a specialist aphid), on the selective value of a defensive chemical compound in Brassica nigra. We found that investment in chemical defense was favored in interspecific competition but disfavored in intraspecific competition and that this pattern of selection was dependent on the presence of both herbivores, suggesting that selection will depend on the rarity or commonness of these species. These results show that the selective value of ecologically important traits depends on the complicated web of interactions present in diverse natural communities and that fluctuations in community composition may maintain genetic variation in such traits.},

Yet appropriate choice tests not confounded by possible effects from phytochemical induction have only been conducted on a few chrysomelid leaf beetle spp. To examine the extent to which cucurbitacins deter feeding across several taxa of mandibulate and haustellate insects, we conducted feeding preference tests, pitting host tissues exogenously coated with a methanol dilution of cucurbitacin B against tissues coated with only methanol. Four mandibulate herbivores [Popillia japonica Newman, Cerotoma trifurcata (Forster), Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) and Trichoplusia ni (Hübner)], 2 mandibulate detritivores [Tenebrio molitor L. and Nauphoeta cinerea (Olivier)] and 4 haustellate herbivores [Gargaphia solani Heidemann, Corythucha ciliata (Say), Peregrinus maidis (Ashmead), and Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris)] were examined. We also investigated the ability of cucurbitacin B to deter Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner) and Spodoptera exiqua (Hübner) females from ovipositing on treated substrates. Two patterns emerged from our feeding assays: nonadapted insects with mandibulate mouthparts were deterred from feeding on food tainted with cucurbitacins, whereas insects with haustellate mouthparts preferred cucurbitacin-treated food. Oviposition assays with O. nubilalis and S. exiqua revealed significant deterrence at doses of 15 μg cucurbitacin B per square centimeter. The data suggest that cucurbitacins are generalized antifeedants for non-adapted mandibulate insects but may actually be phagostimulants for phytophagous insects with haustellate mouthparts. We report on the oviposition deterrence for this class of compounds.},

Mortality of C. torreyi was better predicted by distance from P. semibarbata than by density of C. torreyi . Since not all herbivores are monophagous, interactions involving distance and density effects on plant survival and on vegetational diversity need to be considered with respect to plant and herbivore communities.

Glucosinolate profiles have not been interpreted within a phylogenic framework and little is known regarding the processes that influence the evolution of glucosinolate diversity at a macroevolutionary scale. We have analyzed leaf glucosinolate profiles from members of the Brassicaceae that have diverged from Arabidopsis thaliana within the last 15 million years and interpreted our findings relative to the phylogeny of this group. We identified several interspecific polymorphisms in glucosinolate composition. A majority of these polymorphisms are lineage-specific secondary losses of glucosinolate characters, but a gain-of-character polymorphism was also detected. The genetic basis of most observed polymorphisms appears to be regulatory. In the case of A. lyrata, geographic distribution is also shown to contribute to glucosinolate metabolic diversity. Further, we observed evidence of gene-flow between sympatric species, parallel evolution, and the existence of genetic constraints on the evolution of glucosinolates within the Brassicaceae.},

	abstract = {In 2007, an invasive paropsine beetle, Paropsisterna nr. gloriosa Blackburn, caused severe defoliation of Eucalyptus in mixed-species foliage plantations in south-west Ireland. At many of the plantations, Eucalyptus parvula L.A.S. Johnson \& K.D. Hill was the most heavily damaged species while Eucalyptus pulverulenta Sims was generally resistant to the beetle. However, at the most heavily damaged site beetles moved to feed on E. pulvarulenta presumably during periods when suitable foliage (new leaves) of E. parvula had been severely depleted. The present study examines factors underlying shifts in oviposition from the preferred to non-preferred host. In choice and no-choice experiments, P. nr. gloriosa laid more eggs directly on new E. parvula foliage compared with new E. pulverulenta foliage. However, in choice experiments where new E. parvula foliage was unavailable (but old foliage available), more eggs were laid on new E. pulverulenta foliage. The potential for prior feeding damage to stimulate or deter oviposition on either host was also examined. Prior damage to new and old E. parvula leaves increased egg-laying directly on the damaged foliage; however, prior damage to E. pulverulenta may have inhibited oviposition. The results suggest that in mixed-species plantations, facilitation of oviposition on preferred hosts through prior feeding damage helps maintain the relative resistance of E. pulverulenta against P. nr. gloriosa, even under high beetle densities. However, the vulnerability of E. pulverulenta will increase where suitable age-classes of preferred-host foliage are severely depleted or unavailable.},

We found that (i) the strength of plant genetic effects can be quite high; however, the overall strength of genetic effects on most response variables declined as the levels of organization increased. (ii) Plant genetic effects varied such that introgression had a greater impact on individual phenotypes than extended effects on arthropods or microbes/fungi. By contrast, the greatest effects of genotypic diversity were on arthropods. (iii) Plant genetic effects were greater on above-ground versus below-ground processes, but there was no difference between terrestrial and aquatic environments. (iv) The strength of the effects of intraspecific genotypic diversity tended to be weaker than interspecific genetic introgression. (v) Although genetic effects generally decline across levels of organization, in some cases they do not, suggesting that specific organisms and/or processes may respond more than others to underlying genetic variation. Because patterns in the overall impacts of introgression and genotypic diversity were generally consistent across diverse study systems and consistent with theoretical expectations, these results provide generality for understanding the extended consequences of plant genetic variation across levels of organization, with evolutionary implications.},

	abstract = {Cardamine hirsuta is a European species that was recently introduced into Japan and its wide distribution has been confirmed in the Kanto district. To understand mechanisms of the recent spread of C. hirsuta in Japan, a comparative study of the alien species and its native congeneric species, C. flexuosa, was conducted. Habitat preferences, phenology and seed germination were examined. Cardamine hirsuta and C. flexuosa showed distinctive habitat-preferences; the former was most common in open habitats created by recent man-made constructions, and the latter was common in rice paddy fields and surrounding areas. The results indicate that C. flexuosa is a year-long annual, with a mixed phenology of summer and winter germination and growth. Seed dormancy during summer was relatively weak for C. flexuosa, and some plants that germinated early in summer reproduced during the same summer–autumn period. Plants that germinated in late summer and autumn behaved as winter annuals. In rice paddy fields, C. flexuosa is a winter annual because germination is prevented by submergence during summer. Plants flower during the following spring and complete their life cycle before the fields are flooded for rice cultivation. Cardamine hirsuta showed strong seed dormancy during summer and behaved as a typical winter annual. Seeds of C. hirsuta were intolerant to submergence in water, a condition that breaks seed dormancy of C. flexuosa. The results explain the absence of C. hirsuta from rice paddy fields. It was concluded that the spread of C. hirsuta is attributable to the recent expansion of urban habitats created by human activity and has occurred without direct competition with C. flexuosa. Considering recent urbanization in many areas, it is suggested that C. hirsuta has been spreading rapidly in Japan.},

Interactions among plants and their consumers, pollinators and dispersers are central to evolutionary theory, but interactions among plants themselves have received much less attention. Thus focusing more attention on the evolutionary role of plant–plant interactions may provide greater insight into the processes that organize communities.2. Here, we integrate divergent themes in the literature in an effort to provide a synthesis of empirical evidence and ideas about how plant interactions may affect evolution and how evolution may affect plant interactions.3. First, we discuss the idea of niche partitioning evolving through competitive interactions among plants, the idea of niche construction evolving through facilitative interactions, and the connections between these ideas and more recent research on diversity and ecosystem function and trait-based community organization.4. We then review how a history of coexistence within a region might affect competitive outcomes and explore the mechanisms by which plants exert selective forces on each other. Next, we consider recent research on invasions suggesting that plant interactions can reflect regional evolutionary trajectories. Finally, we place these lines of research into the context of extended phenotypes and the geographic mosaic of co-evolution.5. Synthesis. Our synthesis of separate lines of inquiry is a step towards understanding the evolutionary importance of interactions among plants, and suggests that the evolutionary consequences of interactions contribute to communities that are more than assemblages of independent populations.},

In this review, we argue that many central issues in behavioural ecology will soon become prohibitively difficult to investigate and interpret, thus impeding the rapid progress that characterizes the field. To address these challenges, behavioural ecologists should design studies not only to answer basic scientific questions but also to provide ancillary information for protection and management of their study organisms and habitats, and then share their biological insights with the applied conservation community.},

	abstract = {Polyploidization, or genome duplication, has played a critical role in the diversification of animals, fungi and plants. Little is known about the population structure and multiple origins of polyploid species because of the difficulty in identifying multiple homeologous nuclear genes. The allotetraploid species Arabidopsis kamchatica is closely related to the model species Arabidopsis thaliana and is distributed in a broader climatic niche than its parental species. Here, we performed direct sequencing of homeologous pairs of the low-copy nuclear genes WER and CHS by designing homeolog-specific primers, and obtained also chloroplast and ribosomal internal transcribed spacer sequences. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 50 individuals covering the distribution range including North America are allopolyploids derived from Arabidopsis lyrata and Arabidopsis halleri. Three major clusters within A. kamchatica were detected using Bayesian clustering. One cluster has widespread distribution. The other two are restricted to the southern part of the distribution range including Japan, where the parent A. lyrata is not currently distributed. This suggests that the mountains in Central Honshu and surrounding areas in Japan served as refugia during glacial–interglacial cycles and retained this diversity. We also found that multiple haplotypes of nuclear and chloroplast sequences of A. kamchatica are identical to those of their parental species. This indicates that multiple diploid individuals contributed to the origin of A. kamchatica. The haplotypes of low-copy nuclear genes in Japan suggest independent polyploidization events rather than introgression. Our findings suggest that self-compatibility and gene silencing occurred independently in different origins.},

	abstract = {* 1Induced chemical responses to herbivory have been widely documented, however less attention has been given to the induced morphological defences, particularly those that mediate protection mutualisms. One of the most widely studied mutualisms is the ant–plant protection mutualism, in which ants and other predatory arthropods defend plants against herbivores in exchange for food or housing. * 2Chemical and morphological traits that mediate this protection mutualism attract beneficial partners to plants. Thus induction of traits can lead to greater protection by mutualists when herbivores are present. In this study we examined whether extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) are induced in response to simulated herbivory in Prunus avium. * 3In a greenhouse experiment, continuous damage to seedlings was simulated in two treatments intended to mimic different types of herbivores: (i) 50\% of the area of each leaf was removed using a paper hole punch (e.g. insect herbivore simulation), and (ii) 50\% of the area of each leaf was removed using scissors (e.g. browsing mammal simulation). Seedlings in the control group were not damaged. * 4Post-treatment, damaged plants produced significantly more EFNs per leaf on pre-existing leaves, as well as those that emerged following the onset of damage, than plants in the control group. Regardless of treatment, leaves emerging earlier supported fewer EFNs than leaves emerging later in the experiment. * 5Allocation to defence by seedlings, which have limited resources available, suggests the protection mutualism could be important to plant fitness in the field. Further study of patterns of EFN induction in P. avium seedlings is needed to better understand the significance of this induced response.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have assessed the individual effects of prey nutritional quality or chemical defenses on consumer feeding behavior. However, little is known about how these traits interact to affect consumer feeding and performance. We tested the separate and interactive effects of prey chemical defenses and nutritional quality on the feeding behavior and fitness of six sympatric crustacean mesograzers. Natural concentrations of diterpene alcohols (dictyols) from the brown alga Dictyota menstrualis were incorporated, or not incorporated, into lower quality and higher quality foods to create artificial diets mimicking prey of variable value and defense. Five amphipods (Ampithoe longimana, A. valida, Cymadusa compta, Gammarus mucronatus, and Elasmopus levis) and one isopod (Paracerceis caudata), representing a continuum of closely to distantly related organisms, were fed intact algae or lower and higher quality diets containing or lacking dictyols. All six mesograzers preferred the green alga Enteromorpha intestinalis to the dictyol producing alga Dictyota menstrualis. In assays allowing consumers to choose between simultaneously available foods, dictyols deterred feeding by all five amphipods, but not the isopod; this occurred for both lower and higher quality foods. In no-choice assays, where consumers were confined with only one of our four treatment diets, effects on feeding became more complex. Nutritional quality alone affected feeding by five of the six species. These grazers compensated for lower quality by increasing consumption. Dictyols suppressed feeding for four of the six species. More interestingly, there were significant dictyol × quality interactions for three species. Dictyols decreased feeding more when placed in lower quality foods than higher quality foods. Two amphipods deterred by dictyols in the choice assays readily consumed dictyol-containing foods in no-choice situations and suffered few negative effects of doing so. Although all amphipods were deterred by dictyols in choice assays, dictyols decreased fitness (survivorship, growth, or reproduction) for only four of the five species. These effects included large and immediate decreases in survivorship, dramatic effects on reproduction, and modest effects on female growth. Dictyols enhanced survivorship of the isopod. Thus, the effects of secondary metabolites on feeding in choice situations vs. fitness in long-term assays were inconsistent. For three amphipods, certain effects of food quality, dictyols, or their interaction were detected only for females. In general, negative effects of dictyols on fitness were greater in lower than in higher quality foods, suggesting that prey nutritional value may counteract the effects of defensive metabolites. For example, when G. mucronatus consumed dictyols in lower quality foods, mortality was {\textbackslash}textgreater80\% by day 5; for dictyols in higher quality foods, 80\% mortality took 28 days to develop. Lower quality foods alone significantly decreased growth for the isopod, three of the amphipods, and the females of a fourth amphipod, concomitantly reducing fecundity for four of the five amphipods studied. The effects of both chemical defenses and nutritional quality were unrelated to consumer phylogeny; responses of congeners varied as much, or more, than responses of more distantly related consumers. Understanding mechanisms and consequences of food selection requires that the interactive effects of both chemical defenses and prey nutritional characteristics be considered explicitly.

These rhythms regulate an enormous variety of processes including gene expression, metabolic processes, activity and reproduction. Given the widespread occurrence of circadian systems it is not surprising that extensive efforts have been directed at understanding the adaptive significance of circadian rhythms. In this review we discuss the approaches and findings that have resulted. In studies on organisms in their natural environments, some species show adaptations in their circadian systems that correlate with living at different latitudes, such as clines in circadian clock properties. Additionally, some species show plasticity in their circadian systems suggested to match the demands of their physical and social environment. A number of experiments, both in the field and in the laboratory, have examined the effects of having a circadian system that does not resonate with the organism’s environment. We conclude that the results of these studies suggest that having a circadian system that matches the oscillating environment is adaptive.},

	abstract = {Volatile communication plays an important role in mediating the interactions between plants, aphids, and other organisms in the environment. In response to aphid infestation, many plants initiate indirect defenses through the release of volatiles that attract ladybugs, parasitoid wasps, and other aphid-consuming predators. Aphid-induced volatile release in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana requires the jasmonate signaling pathway. Volatile release is also induced by infection with aphid-transmitted viruses. Consistent with mathematical models of optimal transmission, viruses that are acquired rapidly by aphids induce volatile release to attract migratory aphids, but discourage long-term aphid feeding. Although the ecology of these interactions is well-studied, further research is needed to identify the molecular basis of aphid-induced and virus-induced changes in plant volatile release.},

	abstract = {One of the factors that may complicate biological control of the greenhouse whitefly on Gerbera jamesonii by Encarsia formosa is the rosette shape of this ornamental, which differs from the vertical shape of most vegetable plants (cucumber, egg plant, tomato, etc.). Therefore, host-habitat location and the behaviour prior to landing on uninfested and infested leaves was studied. Attraction of E. formosa from a short distance by infested leaves could not be detected: the parasitoid females landed at random on uninfested and infested leaves. After the first landing, a redistribution of the wasps occurred on the leaves. After 24 h three times as many wasps were found on the infested leaves than on uninfested ones. In a dispersal experiment with four plants, E. formosa appeared to have no preference for landing on leaves of the medium age class, which is the age class on which most of the whiteflies in a suitable stage for parasitism occur. Twenty percent of the parasitoids were found on the plants 20 min after releasing them. These results were independent of the plant cultivar and the host density on the plants. In the course of 8 h, the number of E. formosa females recovered from plants increased linearly, and this increase was greater on plants where hosts were present and also greater on the plant cultivar with the lowest trichome density. After 24 h, the percentage of females was highest (56\%) on plants with the highest host density. E. formosa females were arrested on leaves where hosts were present. Contrary to our expectation, the results from the two G. jamesonii cultivars that differed strongly in leaf hairiness were not significantly different in most experiments. Only at the high host density was parasitism found to be lower on the cultivar with the higher hair density. Parasitoids may walk on top of the `hair coverlet' of cultivars with high trichome density and, therefore, be hampered less than expected.},

	abstract = {Background Co-flowering plant species frequently share pollinators. Pollinator sharing is often detrimental to one or more of these species, leading to competition for pollination. Perhaps because it offers an intriguing juxtaposition of ecological opposites – mutualism and competition – within one relatively tractable system, competition for pollination has captured the interest of ecologists for over a century.Scope Our intent is to contemplate exciting areas for further work on competition for pollination, rather than to exhaustively review past studies. After a brief historical summary, we present a conceptual framework that incorporates many aspects of competition for pollination, involving both the quantity and quality of pollination services, and both female and male sex functions of flowers. Using this framework, we contemplate a relatively subtle mechanism of competition involving pollen loss, and consider how competition might affect plant mating systems, overall reproductive success and multi-species interactions. We next consider how competition for pollination might be altered by several emerging consequences of a changing planet, including the spread of alien species, climate change and pollinator declines. Most of these topics represent new frontiers whose exploration has just begun.Conclusions Competition for pollination has served as a model for the integration of ecological and evolutionary perspectives in the study of species interactions. Its study has elucidated both obvious and more subtle mechanisms, and has documented a range of outcomes. However, the potential for this interaction to inform our understanding of both pure and applied aspects of pollination biology has only begun to be realized.},

Foraging distance information is critical for understanding the scale at which bee populations respond to the landscape, assessing the role of bee pollinators in affecting plant population structure, planning conservation strategies for plants, and designing bee habitat refugia that maintain pollination function for wild and crop plants. We used data from 96 records of 62 bee species to determine whether body size predicts foraging distance. We regressed maximum and typical foraging distances on body size and found highly significant and explanatory nonlinear relationships. We used a second data set to: (1) compare observed reports of foraging distance to the distances predicted by our regression equations and (2) assess the biases inherent to the different techniques that have been used to assess foraging distance. The equations we present can be used to predict foraging distances for many bee species, based on a simple measurement of body size.},

	abstract = {The study of parasite local adaptation, whereby parasites perform better on sympatric hosts than on allopatric hosts and/or better on their own host population than do other parasites, is of great importance to both basic and applied biology. Theoretical examination of host–parasite coevolution predicts that parasite migration rate, generation time and virulence all contribute to the pattern of parasite local adaptation, such that parasites with greater dispersal ability, more frequent reproduction and/or high virulence ought to exhibit increased infectivity on local hosts. Here, we present a meta-analysis of experimental work from 57 host–parasite systems across 54 local adaptation studies to directly test theoretical predictions concerning the effect of each attribute on parasite adaptation. As expected, we find that studies of parasites with higher migration rates than their hosts report local adaptation, as measured by infection success, significantly more often than studies of parasites with relatively low migration rates. Furthermore, this synthesis serves to identify biases in the current body of work and highlight areas with the greatest need for further study. We emphasize the importance of unifying the field with regard to experimental methods, local adaptation definitions and reported statistics for cross-infection studies.},

It follows that generating predictions and testing them correctly requires considering this ecogenetic feedback loop whenever traits have demographic consequences, mediated via density dependence (or frequency dependence). This is not an easy challenge, and arguably theory has advanced at a greater pace than empirical research. However, theory would benefit from more interaction between related fields, as is evident in the many near-synonymous names that the ecogenetic loop has attracted.

	abstract = {Five individuals, each from 13 common species of large macroalgae ('macrophytes') from the western Antarctic Peninsula, were surveyed for the presence of filamentous algal endophytes both macroscopically and microscopically using dissecting and compound microscopes. Of the 13 species surveyed, endophytes were either rare or absent in five. The remaining species all supported endophytes in most or usually all individuals with maximum endophyte densities per species ranging from 3\% to 75\% of the thallus area. Thallus fragments from all individuals with endophytes were placed into culture, and 99 unialgal, filamentous brown algal strains were isolated. The ITS1 gene was sequenced in each strain to sort these into distinct genotypes. Brown algal endophytes grew well in culture, and 10 distinct filamentous genotypes were present. The green endophytes did not grow well in culture, and only two green algal species present in the thallus fragments were isolated. No-choice feeding rate bioassays were performed with thallus fragments of all 13 macrophyte species and with cultures of seven filamentous brown endophytes and both green endophytes. Feeding rates on the endophytes were 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than rates on 12 of the macrophyte species and 2- to 6-fold higher than on the only truly palatable macrophyte. Palmaria decipiens. These data support the hypothesis that Antarctic macrophytes are commonly endophytized and that the endophytes benefit from the association by being protected, at least in part, from amphipod herbivory.

	abstract = {Summary * Below-ground competition is intense and may dramatically reduce plant performance. However, there is still no consensus on the best strategies plants should use to maximize competitive ability in soil. Some suggest plants should grow roots according to nutrient availability, while others suggest plants should grow roots taking into account both nutrients and neighbours. Unambiguously, testing between these two alternative hypotheses has been challenging. * This manuscript had three objectives. First, we presented a model of root growth under competition that is based on an ideal free distribution (IFD). Secondly, we develop the concept of the best response curve as a tool for clearer experimental tests of plant responses to neighbours. Thirdly, we test these ideas by growing fast cycling Brassica rapa either alone or with neighbours to examine this species' root growth strategy both alone and under competition. * We hypothesize that those plants with no direct response to neighbours should grow roots according to an IFD. This means that if plants produce x roots in a soil volume of quality R, they should produce x/n roots in a soil volume of quality R/n. The experimental data were consistent with this prediction. Growing plants with neighbours was statistically identical to growing them with half as many nutrients. Thus, the only effect of neighbours was to reduce nutrient availability. * This model provides an alternative to previous game theoretic models and suggests an experimental protocol based on the concept of the best response curve. We hope that testing the game theoretic model with a clear alternative model will guide experiment and debate. * Synthesis. The data in the literature are mixed, with species sometimes responding to nutrients only, and sometimes responding interactively to both nutrients and neighbours. At present, we lack a general understanding of the causes or consequences of this diversity of strategies. We suggest that a greater understanding of trade-offs among traits that are important for other biotic interactions (above-ground competition, enemy defence, mutualisms) will lead to a greater understanding of why some species over-proliferate roots when in competition but other species do not.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/2461059},
	abstract = {Based on the premise that competition for light is the most important selection pressure on leaf height in forest herbs, I present a game theoretic model for the evolution of this trait which balances the structural costs of a given height increment over an opponent with the resultant photosynthetic benefits. Herbs growing in areas with sparse herbaceous cover are unlikely to be next to and thus under an opponent. Hence, they reap little advantage by being taller, whereas the opposite is true in areas of dense cover. Therefore, the evolutionarily stable strategy favors greater leaf height in productive herb communities having dense coverage than in less productive communities with sparse coverage. In deciduous, cool temperate forests, winter photosynthesis may be limited more by leaf temperature than by light intensity, and thus may favor recumbent basal leaves in evergreen or wintergreen species and seasonal morphs. These ideas are confirmed by data on plant height and coverage from a study along a topographic gradient from a dry oak woods, through a mesic forest, to a floodplain forest. Maximum leaf height roughly doubles with each 7\% increase in herbaceous cover, corresponding rather closely to quantitative predictions based on independent measures of the allometry of support tissue as a function of leaf height. The low stature of evergreen herbs favored by winter conditions appears to restrict their occurrence to dry, sterile sites with low coverage by summer competitors, and may be another factor favoring an association between evergreenness and soil poverty in temperate forest herbs. Patterns of leaf height among orchids native to the northeastern United States correspond to the qualitative predictions of the model. Extensions of the model are sketched for herbs in open habitats; woody plants; higher leaves in reproductive individuals; selection on flower or fruit height; evolutionary advantages of the herbaceous habit in relation to height growth; and the evolution of altruism along relatives. If a species occurs in herbaceous communities of high density only when its neighbors are close relatives, selection may favor the evolution of lower, more "altruistic" leaf heights than with unrelated competitors. Aster macrophyllus, which usually has basal leaves even though it occurs in dense herb communities, is advanced as a possible case of altruism in that its stands are nearly monospecific and appear to be maintained by allelopathic compounds.},

Enzymes able to degrade plant cell wall polysaccharides are widely distributed in micro-organisms but are generally absent in animals, although their presence in insects, especially phytophagous beetles from the superfamilies Chrysomeloidea and Curculionoidea, has recently begun to be appreciated. The observed patchy distribution of endogenous genes encoding these enzymes in animals has raised questions about their evolutionary origins. Recent evidence suggests that endogenous plant cell wall degrading enzymes-encoding genes have been acquired by animals through a mechanism known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT). HGT describes how genetic material is moved by means other than vertical inheritance from a parent to an offspring. Here, we provide evidence that the mustard leaf beetle, Phaedon cochleariae, possesses in its genome genes encoding active xylanases from the glycoside hydrolase family 11 (GH11). We also provide evidence that these genes were originally acquired by P. cochleariae from a species of gammaproteobacteria through HGT.

	abstract = {Optimal plant defense should incorporate any mechanisms that influence the feeding behavior of potential pests. From a diverse collection of examples suggesting that the defense of a plant may be improved in the company of specific neighbors, we discuss a framework of operational mechanisms that begin to clarify some aspects of the recognized influence of species diversity on herbivory. Neighbors serve as insectary plants for herbivore predators and parasites, and influence herbivore feeding behavior by repelling, masking, attracting, and decoying. Insectary plants lower the numerical response of herbivores by increasing the efficiency of their predators and parasites. Repellent plants primarily lower functional response by causing the predator to fail to locate or reject its normal prey. Attractant-decoy plants dilute herbivore impact by drawing off herbivores, either increasing or decreasing their numerical and functional response (or either). The concept of gene conservation guilds adds diversionary and delaying tactics to the adaptation-counteradaptation view of plant-herbivore coevolution. The useful life of a given gene for resistance may best be extended by mechanisms that disrupt genetic tracking (specialization) by herbivores. Some plants may remain inedible not because their chemistry or morphology represents an evolutionary impasse, but because they live in an environment that provides acceptable options of variable quality. Feeding environments that provide little or no choice promote specialization by forcing physiological adaptation. Conversely, the evolutionary momentum of specializing herbivores may be lowered by enhancing their susceptibility, either by selection against virulent individuals, or by decreasing the exposure frequency of susceptible genotypes. The latter mechanism of conserving susceptible individuals takes advantage of herbivore behavioral sensitivity to variable plant quality. Direct selection against virulent genotypes requires temporal cycling of the herbivore population between resistant and nonresistant hosts. Both events may occur within defense guilds that provide acceptable feeding options of similar but distinctive quality.},

To determine if an unwillingness to consume secondary metabolites from potential foods limited the dietary range of Stylocheilus, we fed it a series of artificial diets containing secondary metabolites (malyngamide A and malyngamide B from Microcoleus; caulerpenyne, caulerpin, halimedatetraacetate, pachydictyol A and ochtodene from other algal species; chondrillin, luffariellolide and a brominated diphenyl ether from sponges). We performed one set of no-choice feeding trials and two sets of choice feeding trials. The details of the results varied between experiments; however, every secondary metabolite significantly reduced feeding by Stylocheilus in at least one set of trials. Overall, malyngamide A and B were as or more effective at deterring feeding by Stylocheilus than were most other secondary metabolites, suggesting that Stylocheilus is not particularly adapted to the secondary chemistry of Microcoleus and that the secondary chemistry of other algae does not limit Stylocheilus to a specialized diet. Widespread dispersal of Stylocheilus during its planktonic larval phase probably precludes local adaptation to the geographically variable secondary metabolites found in Microcoleus. Several alternate hypotheses might explain why Stylocheilus specializes despite disliking the secondary metabolites of its host; these hypotheses remain to be tested.},

	abstract = {Generalist mammalian herbivores exploit a diverse diet. A generalised feeding strategy utilises a mixed diet to obtain a range of nutrients and to reduce the detoxication load of similar groups of plant secondary metabolites (PSMs). There is limited research investigating how mammalian herbivores achieve this dietary mixing in their daily foraging activities. We investigated the patterns of, and behaviours associated with, dietary mixing in a generalist mammalian folivore, the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). Possums were offered foliage of two eucalypt species (Eucalyptus globulus and E. regnans) as either (a) Full choice: both species offered for 8 h; (b) Restricted choice: both species offered for 2×2 h blocks; (c) G–R no choice: E. globulus offered for the first 4 h, E. regnans offered for next 4 h; and (d) R–G no choice: E. regnans offered for first 4 h, E. globulus offered for next 4 h. We hypothesised that possums would maximise intake on the Full choice diet, where time availability was greatest in combination with a choice of foliage. We also hypothesised that diet switching, defined as the frequency of changing between food types while feeding, would play a fundamental role in maximising intake. Possums achieved maximum intake on the Full choice diet and minimum intake on the No choice diets. Although intake was similar between the Restricted choice and No choice diets, possums achieved this intake in half the amount of time when able to switch regularly between foliage on the Restricted choice diet. We conclude that a generalist herbivore’s ability to effectively switch diets when foraging is fundamental to maximising intake. Hence, the degree of plant heterogeneity in an environment, and the spatial scale at which it occurs, may affect an herbivore’s foraging decisions and, ultimately, influence its foraging efficiency.},

Population genetic structure was assessed by analysing genetic diversity indices for each population, examining clustering (model-based and distance-based) among populations, evaluating signals of recent bottlenecks, and testing for isolation by distance (IBD).Results The 33 populations were clustered into five groups. The isolated marginal groups of populations (in Kamchatka, Kii in Japan and South Korea) exhibited low levels of allelic richness and gene diversity and a complete or almost complete loss of rare alleles. A recent bottleneck was detected in the populations in Hokkaido across to mid-Sakhalin. The IBD analysis revealed that genetic divergence between populations was higher for populations separated by straits.Main conclusions Picea jezoensis showed a higher level of genetic differentiation among populations (FST = 0.101) than that observed in the genus Picea in general. This might be attributable to the fact that historically the straits around Japan acted as barriers to the movement of seeds and pollen. The low levels of genetic diversity in the isolated marginal population groups may reflect genetic drift that has occurred after isolation. Evidence of a significant bottleneck between the Hokkaido and mid-Sakhalin populations implies that the cold, dry climate in the late Pleistocene resulted in the decline and contraction of populations, and that there was a subsequent expansion followed by a founder effect when conditions improved. The high polymorphism observed in P. jezoensis nuclear microsatellites revealed cryptic genetic structure that organellar DNA markers failed to identify in a previous study.},

	abstract = {1Ecologically significant evolutionary change, occurring over tens of generations or fewer, is now widely documented in nature. These findings counter the long-standing assumption that ecological and evolutionary processes occur on different time-scales, and thus that the study of ecological processes can safely assume evolutionary stasis. Recognition that substantial evolution occurs on ecological time-scales dissolves this dichotomy and provides new opportunities for integrative approaches to pressing questions in many fields of biology.2The goals of this special feature are twofold: to consider the factors that influence evolution on ecological time-scales – phenotypic plasticity, maternal effects, sexual selection, and gene flow – and to assess the consequences of such evolution – for population persistence, speciation, community dynamics, and ecosystem function.3The role of evolution in ecological processes is expected to be largest for traits that change most quickly and for traits that most strongly influence ecological interactions. Understanding this fine-scale interplay of ecological and evolutionary factors will require a new class of eco-evolutionary dynamic modelling.4Contemporary evolution occurs in a wide diversity of ecological contexts, but appears to be especially common in response to anthropogenic changes in selection and population structure. Evolutionary biology may thus offer substantial insight to many conservation issues arising from global change.5Recent studies suggest that fluctuating selection and associated periods of contemporary evolution are the norm rather than exception throughout the history of life on earth. The consequences of contemporary evolution for population dynamics and ecological interactions are likely ubiquitous in time and space.},

Earlier work has found this variation to have a large genetic component. Willow clones are stable in their resistances between midge generations and different nutrient levels in both field and laboratory culture. * 2This study reports the results of laboratory experiments on female oviposition choice and larval survival on potted plants from clones that are very different in resistance as determined in field studies. * 3In choice experiments using pairs of plants, the average female midge did not prefer susceptible willow clones over resistant ones for oviposition. In about one third of the replicates, midges actually laid more eggs on the resistant clone. Further work is necessary to examine the nature of variation among midges in discrimination of these plant types. * 4Resistance is manifested as great differences in larval survival. Six days after oviposition survival was 92\% on susceptible plants but only 6\% on resistant ones. Galls developed on all of the susceptible plants, while in 73\% of the resistant plants galls were not even initiated. * 5The plant traits causing resistance are enigmatic. Larval behaviour suggests that resistant plants interfere with feeding behaviour. On resistant plants, most larvae wander for more than 24 h without initiating any galls before dying. On susceptible plants many first instar larvae begin feeding and initiate galls within this period.},

If these insects use several host plants, the evolution of oviposition preference hierarchiesis expected, with the patterns of preference for any given host corresponding to larval performance on that host. We examined the oviposition preference hierarchy of Brachys tessellatus (F.), a Buprestid leafmining beetle, on 5 Quercus species that the beetle hasbeen observed to use as host plants. Two laboratory experiments were performed, involving a combination of no-choice and 2-choice behavioral trials. Patterns of preference in the wild was also assessed using a survey of egg densities on hosts in the field. The 2 laboratory behavioral trials revealed identical preference hierarchies, with preference for Quercus marylandica {\textbackslash}textgreater Q. laevis {\textbackslash}textgreater Q. incana {\textbackslash}textgreater Q. nigra {\textbackslash}textgreater Q. margaretta. These results contrasted with the observations in the wild where egg densities reflected the pattern Q. laevis {\textbackslash}textgreater Q. marylandica {\textbackslash}textgreater Q. incana {\textbackslash}textgreater Q. nigra {\textbackslash}textgreater Q. margaretta. This variation for the 2 most preferred hosts suggests that the laboratory results may not reflect environmental effects such as host abundance and sun versus shade effects that may influence the patterns of oviposition site preference observedin the wild.},

Reciprocal hybridization between H. armigera and H. assulta followed by backcrossing of the hybrids (F1) with H. armigera was also carried out for genetic study on host selection of these two insect species. A two-choice test with cotton and bush redpepper leaf discs showed that H. armigera larvae preferred to feed on cotton, and H. assulta larvae to bush redpepper; feeding preferences of the two F1 lines were intermediate between those of their parents, but close to that of their female parent; preference indexes of backcross lines also showed that both maternal factor and chromosomal inheritance were involved in feeding selection of two Helicoverpa species.},

I propose that simple signals overcome the problem of multiple sensory inputs and the consequent need for the brain to decide among inputs from these multiple channels. Experiments on grasshoppers show that there is a significant time cost in having to make a choice, relative to situations in which individuals have grown accustomed to having no choice. Those with a choice were shown to be less decisive by two different measures than those without a choice. It is argued that the data, showing lengthy decision times as a result of having a choice, would involve a significant ecological risk. It is further argued that the reduced risk of quick decisions would favor specialization of resource use. The evolution of resource‐specific cues that have often been called sign stimuli are considered critical elements of restricted resource use.},

Similarly, experimental leaf damage increased the proportion of flowers and seeds that were cleistogamous. Leaf damage also reduced the biomass of cleistogamous progeny more severely relative to that of chasmogamous progeny. The cumulative effect of leaf damage was to increase plant reliance on fitness derived from cleistogamous progeny. Leaf damage indirectly affected mating system traits by reducing chasmogamous flower size, leading to a reduction in pollinator visitation. Under these experimental conditions, herbivory did not significantly reduce the number of simultaneously open flowers and potential for geitonogamy, nor did it result in significant changes in the composition of the pollinator fauna. These findings are among the first to demonstrate that herbivory has consequences for mating system and should be considered a factor shaping mating system evolution.},

We tested the hypothesis that a generalist marsupial herbivore, the common brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, can maintain a higher intake of food when allowed to select from two diets containing different profiles of secondary compounds (phenolics and terpenes) than when given access to the diets individually. Diets consisted of a fruit and vegetable mash to which was added ground leaves of either Eucalyptus melliodora or E. radiata. E. melliodora and E. radiata differ in their concentrations and types of secondary compounds. Brushtail possums include these eucalypt species as part of their natural diet. We measured food consumption and detoxification metabolites of possums on these diets. Consistent with the hypothesis, animals presented with a choice of both diets consumed more food than animals given diets singly. One of the two indicators of detoxification, acid load in urine, differed significantly between diets while the other, glucuronic acid, did not. These results provide partial support for the hypothesis that diet breadth is governed by detoxification abilities.},

The green algae Ulva spathulata and Enteromorpha intestinalis were consumed at the highest rates in both no-choice (2.3-2.5 mg blotted weight individual-1 day-1) and multiple-choice assays (0.5-1.3 mg blotted weight individual-1 day-1). Adult A. typica collected from two different species of brown seaweeds had very similar feeding preferences to each other. Juvenile A. typica grew to reproductive maturity on the green algae E. intestinalis and U. spathulata, and the brown algae Carpophyllum maschalocarpum and Ecklonia radiata. In common with previous studies on members of other amphipod families, survivorship of juvenile amphipods was positively correlated with feeding preferences of adults across seaweed species (r 2=0.43, P=0.04). However, densities of A. typica on seaweeds in the field (excluding the intertidal E. intestinalis and U. spathulata) were not significantly correlated with feeding preferences of adults (r 2=0.07, P=0.5) or survivorship of juveniles (r 2=0.17, P=0.31). This suggests that either host seaweeds are not a major dietary component of these amphipods in nature, or that the host's value as a food source is overridden by other properties such as the degree of shelter it affords from larger consumers. This study provides the first demonstration that a member of the cosmopolitan amphipod family Aoridae is capable of consuming a diverse range of seaweeds.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {1. By selective grazing, invasive grazers can alter macrophyte-herbivore relationships in shallow freshwater bodies. Evaluating the palatability of macrophytes and understanding the determinants of plant palatability can help predict grazing impact. In no-choice feeding assays, we tested the palatability of 21 species of freshwater macrophytes to the invasive freshwater apple snail Pomacea canaliculata.2. Daily feeding rate varied greatly with plant species, ranging from 1.1 to 22\% of snail body mass. We assessed six plant properties and examined their correlation with feeding rate. Total nitrogen content was positively related, and C:N ratio and dry matter content (DMC) negatively related, to snail feeding rate. There was no significant correlation between snail feeding rate and plant phenolic content, but the feeding rate on Myriophyllum aquaticum (the plant with the highest phenolic content) was very low.3. We repeated the feeding assays for 15 species that were not palatable as fresh leaves with reconstituted plant tissues formed by mixing ground up dried leaves with agar. The feeding rate still differed greatly among macrophyte species. Phragmites australis and Vallisneria natans (two species with the highest DMC) were eaten much more as reconstituted plant than as fresh leaves, indicating that structure (i.e. DMC) may be important in their defence against snail herbivory. For two plants (M. aquaticum and Alternanthera philoxeroides) that had moderate amounts of nitrogen/phosphorus but were consumed very little as fresh and reconstituted tissues, we incorporated their extracts into a palatable agar-based food. The extracts from both species greatly reduced snail feeding rate, indicating the presence of chemical defences in these two species.4. These results indicated that feeding was affected by several plant traits. The snail favoured plants with a high nitrogen content and avoided plants with a high DMC. Only a few plants possessed chemical feeding deterrents that were effective against this snail. Given the invasive spread of P. canaliculata in Asia, ecologists and managers should consider plant palatability when selecting plants for use in wetland restoration and when predicting the impact of further invasion by this species.},

	abstract = {The genus Nepenthes, a carnivorous plant, has a pitcher to trap insects and digest them in the contained fluid to gain nutrient. A distinctive character of the pitcher fluid is the digestive enzyme activity that may be derived from plants and dwelling microbes. However, little is known about in situ digestive enzymes in the fluid. Here we examined the pitcher fluid from four species of Nepenthes. High bacterial density was observed within the fluids, ranging from 7×106 to 2.2×108 cells ml−1. We measured the activity of three common enzymes in the fluid: acid phosphatases, β-d-glucosidases, and β-d-glucosaminidases. All the tested enzymes detected in the liquid of all the pitcher species showed activity that considerably exceeded that observed in aquatic environments such as freshwater, seawater, and sediment. Our results indicate that high enzyme activity within a pitcher could assist in the rapid decomposition of prey to maximize efficient nutrient use. In addition, we filtered the fluid to distinguish between dissolved enzyme activity and particle-bound activity. As a result, filtration treatment significantly decreased the activity in all enzymes, while pH value and Nepenthes species did not affect the enzyme activity. It suggested that enzymes bound to bacteria and other organic particles also would significantly contribute to the total enzyme activity of the fluid. Since organic particles are themselves usually colonized by attached and highly active bacteria, it is possible that microbe-derived enzymes also play an important role in nutrient recycling within the fluid and affect the metabolism of the Nepenthes pitcher plant.},

Here we argue that understanding the basis of food mixing (i.e., eating different food types) and food selection behavior is central to understanding the causes and consequences of omnivory. Despite the existence of several alternative hypotheses, constraints imposed by nutrients are often assumed to explain the function of food mixing by omnivores and herbivores. However, few studies have actually addressed this issue through rigorous tests of multiple hypotheses. To illustrate the importance of non-nutritive factors, we marshal evidence for the roles of toxin dilution, parasite avoidance and resistance, and predation risk in food mixing and food selection by omnivores and polyphagous herbivores. Whether food mixing stabilizes population, community, and food web dynamics is likely to depend on the details of food selection and the spatial and temporal scales of food mixing.},

We utilized Ler and Cvi, two ecotypes of Arabidopsis that have striking differences in both the types and amounts of glucosinolates that accumulate in the seeds and leaves. QTL analysis identified six loci determining total aliphatic glucosinolate accumulation, six loci controlling total indolic glucosinolate concentration, and three loci regulating benzylic glucosinolate levels. Our results show that two of the loci controlling total aliphatic glucosinolates map to biosynthetic loci that interact epistatically to regulate aliphatic glucosinolate accumulation. In addition to the six loci regulating total indolic glucosinolate concentration, mapping of QTL for the individual indolic glucosinolates identified five additional loci that were specific to subsets of the indolic glucosinolates.

	abstract = {Carnivora includes three independent evolutionary transitions to the marine environment: pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walruses), sea otters, and polar bears. All three lineages must contend with the thermal challenges of submersion in the marine environment. In the present study, we investigated changes in the fur associated with the transition from a terrestrial to an aquatic lifestyle, comparing fur characteristics among these lineages with those of semi-aquatic and strictly terrestrial carnivores. Characteristics included gross morphology (hair cuticle shape, circularity, length, and density) and thermal conductivity. We found consistent trends in hair morphology associated with aquatic living, such that marine carnivores have significantly flatter (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001), shorter (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001), and denser hairs (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001) than terrestrial carnivores. However, sea lions, phocids, and walrus, which have thicker blubber layers than fur seals, have lower fur densities than fur seals (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). Species utilizing fur for insulation in water also showed an elongation of hair cuticle scales compared to terrestrial species and marine species relying on blubber for insulation (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). By testing pelts under hydrostatic pressure, we determined that flattening of the hairs, cuticular scale elongation, and increased fur density are critical characteristics for maintaining an insulating air layer within the fur during submersion. Overall, these results indicate consistent evolutionary modifications to the fur associated with the transition to aquatic living, as well as a decrease in fur function associated with a greater reliance on blubber in some groups. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2012, ••, ••–••.},

We tested for effects of plant chemical defenses on seed survival by manipulating the frequency of palatable and less palatable sunflower seeds in food patches subject to harvest by fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) and gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis). We varied resource distributions at three scales: among stations (aggregates of patches ca. 50 m apart), among patches immediately adjacent to each other, and within patches. When food patches were segregated into high-palatability and low-palatability stations (Experiment 1), seeds suffered greater mortality at stations with high levels of palatable seeds. In the same experiment, within patches, squirrels selected strongly for palatable seeds over less palatable seeds. When high- and low-palatability food patches were placed together at the same stations (Experiment 2), increasing densities of co-occurring palatable seeds amplified the mortality of less palatable seeds, indicating “shared doom.” When palatable and less palatable seeds were partitioned into micropatches (Experiment 3), associational effects disappeared, as predicted. Furthermore, selectivity in less palatable patches increased as the initial densities of palatable seeds increased, and selectivity in palatable patches decreased as the initial densities of less palatable seeds increased. Foraging theory predicts associational effects among prey that vary in palatability. Our results show how the type and magnitude of associational effects emerge from the interplay among the spatial scale of prey heterogeneity, the diet selection strategy, and the scale-dependent foraging responses of the consumer.},

	abstract = {1 The patterns of above ground allocation of meristems and resources are primary components of plant life history strategies, and are reflected in fecundity allocation, i.e. the observed relationship between plant size and fecundity. Phenotypic plasticity in fecundity allocation was investigated in the annual Arabidopsis thaliana. Individuals of each of three genotypes were grown under light, nutrient and pot volume gradients. Plant size (above ground vegetative mass excluding seeds) and fecundity (number of seeds) were measured for each individual at complete senescence. 2 In all combinations of three genotypes and three environmental factors, fecundity increased significantly with increasing plant size (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). This increase was expressed through linear, quadratic, cubic and exponential relationships. Analyses of covariance with transformed data indicated that size-fecundity relationships were variable both between factors for individual genotypes and between genotypes within environmental factors. Hence not only size and fecundity, but also the relationship between size and fecundity can display phenotypic plasticity in this species. 3 Under light limitation some plants remained vegetative throughout their life span and it was therefore possible to identify a minimum size necessary to initiate production of reproductive meristems. However, some individuals of the same genotypes under nutrient limitation flowered and set seed although they were below this size limit. Hence, the minimum size for reproduction may also show phenotypic plasticity in A. thaliana. The observed variability in minimum size for reproduction and in fecundity allocation was not due to variation in developmental stage since all plants were harvested after fully completing their development. 4 Phenotypic plasticity in fecundity allocation and minimum size for reproduction implies that plants of the same size, in different environments, may not have the same fecundity, even if they are the same genotype. This plasticity has important implications in the interpretation of fitness estimates and in comparisons of life histories in plants.},

	abstract = {1. Herbivores exert significant selection on plants, and plants have evolved a variety of constitutive and inducible defences to resist and tolerate herbivory. Assessing the genetic mechanisms that influence defences against herbivores will deepen our understanding of the evolution of essential phenotypic traits.2. Ecogenomics is a powerful interdisciplinary approach that can address fundamental questions about the ecology and evolutionary biology of species, such as: which evolutionary forces maintain variation within a population? and What is the genetic architecture of adaptation? This field seeks to identify gene regions that influence ecologically important traits, assess the fitness consequences under natural conditions of alleles at key quantitative trait loci (QTLs), and test how the abiotic and biotic environment affects gene expression.3. Here, we review ecogenomics techniques and emphasize how this framework can address long-standing and emerging questions relating to anti-herbivore defences in plants. For example, ecogenomics tools can be used to investigate: inducible vs. constitutive defences; tradeoffs between resistance and tolerance; adaptation to the local herbivore community; selection on alleles that confer resistance and tolerance in natural populations; and whether different genes are activated in response to specialist vs. generalist herbivores and to different types of damage.4. Ecogenomic studies can be conducted with model species, such as Arabidopsis, or their relatives, in which case myriad molecular tools are already available. Burgeoning sequence data will also facilitate ecogenomic studies of non-model species. Throughout this paper, we highlight approaches that are particularly suitable for ecological studies of non-model organisms, discuss the benefits and disadvantages of specific techniques and review bioinformatic tools for analysing data.5. We focus on established and promising techniques, such as QTL mapping with pedigreed populations, genome wide association studies, transcription profiling strategies, population genomics and transgenic methodologies. Many of these techniques are complementary and can be used jointly to investigate the genetic architecture of defence traits and selection on alleles in nature.},

Degradation of JAZ proteins in Arabidopsis leads to the release of a bHLH transcription factor, MYC2, which functions as a master regulator of JA-dependent defense responses. Because the activity of the MYC2 coincides with the presence of active jasmonate in cells, it is unlikely that MYC2, alone, regulates prolonged transcriptional responses of genes encoding enzymes required for the accumulation of defense metabolites. In this review, we focus on MYC2 and a specific group of MYC2-regulated ?secondary? transcription factors as critical components of the JA signal transduction pathway that controls inducible chemical defense responses in plants.},

	abstract = {Heterospecific neighbors may reduce damage to a focal plant by lowering specialist herbivore loads (associational resistance hypothesis), or enhance damage by increasing generalist herbivore loads (associational susceptibility hypothesis). We tested the associational effects of tree diversity on herbivory patterns of the tropical focal tree Tabebuia rosea in an experimental plantation setup, which contained tree monocultures and mixed stands. We found higher herbivore damage to T. rosea at higher tree diversity, indicating that T. rosea did not benefit from associational resistance but rather experienced associational susceptibility. The specific consideration of the two dominant insect herbivore species of T. rosea, the specialist chrysomelid Walterianella inscripta and the specialist pyralid Eulepte gastralis, facilitated understanding of the detected damage patterns. Tree diversity exerted opposite effects on tree infestation by the two herbivores. These findings point to resource concentration effects for the chrysomelid beetle (favored by tree monoculture) and to resource dilution effects for the pyralid caterpillar (favored by tree mixture) as underlying mechanisms of herbivore distribution. A strong contribution of the pyralid to overall damage patterns in diversified stands suggests that associational susceptibility may not necessarily be related to higher abundances of generalist herbivores but may also result from specialized herbivores affected by resource dilution effects. Thus, the identity and biology of herbivore species has to be taken into account when attempting to predict damage patterns in forest ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The production of both potentially outcrossed (chasmogamous) and obligately self-fertilized (cleistogamous) flowers presents a clear exception to the prediction that the only evolutionarily stable mating systems are complete selfing and complete outcrossing. Although cleistogamy has evolved repeatedly, the reason for its stability is not known for any species. We tested the hypothesis that the production of cleistogamous and chasmogamous flowers by a perennial violet constitutes adaptive phenotypic plasticity. We manipulated the season of flowering for each flower type and determined fruit set and the germination percentage of seeds produced by cleistogamous and chasmogamous flowers to test the hypothesis that adaptive plastic response to seasonal environmental variation makes mixed mating stable. Cleistogamous flowers had greater fruit set in all seasons and produced seeds with germination percentages as great as or greater than those from chasmogamous flowers. The consistent advantage of cleistogamous flowers is clearly not consistent with a role of adaptive plastic response to seasonal variation. The biomass cost of seed production by chasmogamous flowers was nearly three times that for cleistogamous flowers. Explaining why chasmogamous flower have not been eliminated by natural selection requires that this difference be balanced by an advantage to chasmogamous flowers that has not yet been identified.},

	abstract = {An experimental assessment of the defence hypothesis of nickel (Ni) hyperaccumulation in Alyssum was lacking. Also, to date no study had investigated the effects of hyperaccumulator litter on a detritivore species. We performed several experiments with model arthropods representatives of two trophic levels: Tribolium castaneum (herbivore) and Porcellio dilatatus (detritivore). In no-choice trials using artificial food disks with different Ni concentrations, T. castaneum fed significantly less as Ni concentration increased and totally rejected disks with the highest Ni concentration. In choice tests, insects preferred disks without Ni. In the no-choice experiment, mortality was low and did not differ significantly among treatments. Hence, this suggested a deterrent effect of high Ni diet. Experiments with P. dilatatus showed that isopods fed A. pintodasilvae litter showed significantly greater mortality (83\%) than isopods fed litter from the non-hyperaccumulator species Iberis procumbens (8\%), Micromeria juliana (no mortality) or Alnus glutinosa (no mortality). Also, isopods consumed significantly greater amounts of litter from the non-hyperaccumulator plant species. The behaviour of isopods fed A. pintodasilvae litter suggested an antifeedant effect of Ni, possibly due to post-ingestive toxic effects. Our results support the view that Ni defends the Portuguese serpentine hyperaccumulator A. pintodasilvae against herbivores, indicating that Ni can account both for feeding deterrence and toxic effects. The effects of hyperaccumulator litter on the detritivore P. dilatatus suggest that the activity of these important organisms may be significantly impaired with potential consequences on the decomposition processes.},

Empirical evidence in natural populations reveals that individual plants allocate resources simultaneously to both strategies, thus plants exhibit a mixed pattern of defense. In this review we examine the conditions that promote the evolutionary stability of mixed defense strategies in the light of available empirical and theoretical evidence. Given that plant tolerance and resistance are heritable and subject to environmentally dependent selection and genetic constraints, the joint evolution of tolerance and resistance is analyzed, with consideration of multiple species interactions and the plant mating system. The existence of mixed defense strategies in plants makes it necessary to re-explore the coevolutionary process between plants and herbivores, which centered historically on resistance as the only defensive mechanism. In addition, we recognize briefly the potential use of plant tolerance for pest management. Finally, we highlight unresolved issues for future development in this field of evolutionary ecology.},

To exclude the possibility that the hinds used small differences in brightness to distinguish between the green and the grey stimulus, we conducted a test that differed from the training situation. A light green positive stimulus combined with a dark grey negative stimulus was alternated with a dark green positive stimulus combined with a light grey negative stimulus on every second trial. The positive green stimuli had different reflectance spectra. After training, each of the four hinds showed over 80\% correct responses in the test.

Leptinotarsa undecimlineata feeds exclusively on Solanum lanceolatum L. (Solanaceae) in the centre of Veracruz, Mexico. A common sympatric species, Solanum myriacanthum Dunal, is not used as host. We conducted a series of laboratory experiments to detect reasons for the exclusive use of one host plant. Leptinotarsa undecimlineata larvae were reared under laboratory conditions on both plant species, Solanum lanceolatum and S. myriacanthum. Length of larval stages, pupal weight, and percent adult eclosion were compared, and larval preference for both Solanum species was tested. Upon eclosion, adult females were exposed to each of the plants, and the effect of larval diet on adult preference was determined. Oviposition on both Solanum species was observed in no-choice tests. Larvae showed no significant preferences for either plant species. Pupal weight, however, was significantly higher on S. lanceolatum. Female beetles significantly preferred S. lanceolatum leaves, and no effect of preimaginal conditioning was found. Females reproduced in lower numbers after feeding on S. myriacanthum, oviposition initiated later, and females laid fewer eggs than females fed with S. lanceolatum. No female accepted S. myriacanthum for oviposition. Results obtained suggest that the potential host breadth of L. undecimlineata is broader in larvae than in female beetles.},

This neural–constraints hypothesis predicts that generalist herbivores should make slower or poorer decisions than specialists when selecting plants, because generalists must discriminate and decide among stimuli from a wider variety of potential hosts. The present study compares the speed with which host–associated decisions are made in specialist versus generalist populations of the aphid Uroleucon ambrosiae. Populations of U. ambrosiae from eastern North America are highly specific to the host plant Ambrosia trifida (Asteraceae), whereas those from the American southwest also feed on a variety of other taxa from the Asteraceae. Experiments with winged (alate) and wingless (apterous) individuals showed that host–finding, host–selection, host–acceptance, host–sampling and host–settling were more efficiently performed by the eastern specialists. These very consistent results provide evidence that strongly supports the neural–constraints hypothesis.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Several hypotheses, mainly Optimal Defense (OD), Carbon:Nutrient Balance (CNB), Growth Rate (GR), and Growth‐Differentiation Balance (GDB), have individually served as frameworks for investigating the patterns of plant defense against herbivores, in particular the pattern of constitutive defense. The predictions and tests of these hypotheses have been problematic for a variety of reasons and have led to considerable confusion about the state of the “theory of plant defense.” The primary contribution of the OD hypothesis is that it has served as the main framework for investigation of genotypic expression of plant defense, with the emphasis on allocation cost of defense. The primary contribution of the CNB hypothesis is that it has served as the main framework for investigation of how resources affect phenotypic expression of plant defense, often with studies concerned about allocation cost of defense. The primary contribution of the GR hypothesis is that it explains how intrinsic growth rate of plants shaped evolutionarily by resource availability affects defensive patterns. The primary contribution of the expanded GDB hypothesis is that it recognizes the constant physiological tradeoff between growth and differentiation at the cellular and tissue levels relative to the selective pressures of resource availability, including explicitly taking into account plant tolerance of damage by enemies. A clearer understanding of these hypotheses and what we have learned from investigations that use them can facilitate development of well‐designed experiments that address the gaps in our knowledge of plant defense.},

Individual ramets can decrease reproduction if their neighbors are ramets of the same genet due to inbreeding depression or self-incompatibility. We assessed ramet reproductive success in the partial self-incompatible Ferocactus robustus (Cactaceae) as a function of floral display size in focal ramets and floral display size and clonal structure of their reproductive neighborhoods. Ramets were labeled, sized in number of stems, mapped and genetically identified through RAPD markers in one population. A pollen dispersal area of 15-m radius was established for each ramet to determine the clonal diversity in the neighborhoods. Flower production and fruit set were counted on a monthly basis during one reproductive season as a surrogate of ramet fitness. We expected a decrease in individual ramet reproductive success as a function of the number of reproductive ramets of the same genet in the neighborhood. A total of 272 sampled ramets revealed 116 multilocus genotypes, showing high clonal diversity in the population (G/N = 0.43, D = 0.98). Clonal diversity of neighborhoods ranged from 0.06 to 1 and fruit set varied from 0 to 76.9\%. Individual ramet reproductive success was influenced by (1) mate availability, (2) floral display size of a genet within the reproductive neighborhood, and (3) the proportion of distinguishable genotypes. Floral display size of genets and ramets coupled with the genetic diversity within the reproductive neighborhood determines the low sexual reproduction in F. robustus.},

	abstract = {Reduced palatability through lowered nutritional content is a common defense for modular or gelatinous organisms, but commonly thought unavailable for active, mobile animals. However, nudibranchs – a group of brightly colored, shell-less snails – may supplement their chemical defenses via increased water and ash content. Among 33 gastropod species, nudibranchs differed from prosobranch snails by containing approximately half the digestible organic material per unit wet weight, indicating their caloric value per unit volume will likewise be less than that of shelled snails. Nudibranchs also allocated proportionally less organic material to exterior body regions than to the viscera. Because exterior regions are more easily regenerated and often contain nematocysts or high concentrations of chemical defense, the areas of slug bodies most vulnerable to attack are the best defended, the least valuable to potential predators, and the least costly for nudibranchs to replace. To test how these differences in organic content affect palatability to predators, I offered to Cancer productus, a common molluscivorous crab, pellets differing in organic content (12\% or 22\% of wet weight) and secondary chemistry (presence or absence of Archidoris montereyensis extract). In no-choice bioassays, chemical extracts reduced feeding by approximately 50\%, while lowered organic content reduced feeding by approximately 19\%. The effects of organic content did not significantly interact with those caused by chemical extracts, suggesting that, in some contexts, reduced nutritional quality offers a somewhat independent form of antipredator deterrence. Although the nutritional context of defenses is often considered in studies of plants and other organisms suffering partial predation, this study shows that such a multi-factor approach should be more commonly extended to mobile animals.},

The average dry weight of the edible parts in the medium or late types was 2-fold higher (3.20 g) than that of the early types (1.61 g). The relative proportion of each edible part to the dry weight in the early types was approximately 31, 35, and 35\% for the flower buds, leaves, and stems, respectively. However, in the medium or late types, the leaf proportion was six times higher than that of the flower buds. Two GSL compounds, gluconapin, and glucobrassicanapin, were mainly found in all the edible parts. The relative proportion of gluconapin to the total GSL content was higher than that of glucobrassicanapin in the early types, but the reverse was observed in the medium or late types. The total GSL content of edible parts, recalculated by using the percentage of dry weight to the sum weight, ranged from 60 to 80 mmol kg−1 DW in all the cultivars, except for ‘Syunrai’ (30 mmol kg−1 DW) and ‘No. 88’ (31 mmol kg−1 DW). The high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) profile patterns of the seeds and vegetative tissues were similar, with different amounts, particularly gluconapin. A nonsignificant positive correlation was observed between the total GSL content in the seeds and vegetative tissues (R 2 = 0.1758). Although gluconapin was the only GSL to be found in the seeds, both gluconapin and glucobrassicanapin occurred in the edible parts.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that genetically based traits of plants can structure associated arthropod and microbial communities, but whether the effects are consistent and repeatable across years is unknown. If communities are both heritable (i.e., related individuals tend to support similar communities) and repeatable (i.e., the same patterns observed over multiple years), then plant genetics may also affect community properties previously thought to be emergent, such as "stability." Using replicated clones of narrowleaf cottonwood (Populus angustifolia) and examining an arthropod community of 103 species, we found that (1) individual tree genotypes supported significantly different arthropod communities, which exhibited broad-sense heritability; (2) these findings were highly repeatable over three consecutive years (repeatability = 0.91) indicating that community responses to individual tree genotypes are consistent from year to year; (3) differences among tree genotypes in community stability (i.e., changes in community composition over multiple years) exhibited broad-sense heritability ( {\textbackslash}textlesstex-math{\textbackslash}textgreater\$H\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashtext\{C\}\}ˆ\{2\}=0.32\${\textbackslash}textless/tex-math{\textbackslash}textgreater ). In combination, these findings suggest that an emergent property such as stability can be genetically based and thus subject to natural selection.},

In choice and no-choice experiments, mated adult L. trifolii females were given access for 48 h to potato plants, and caged on differently aged leaves. The extent of their feeding and oviposition on the 5–7 leaflets of the upper, middle, and lower leaves were recorded. The life history variables of the next generation were estimated: percentage egg hatch, number of mines formed, larval survival, number of pupae formed, size and weight of pupae, percentage pupation, number of adults formed, percentage emergence, size and weight of adults, sex ratio, adult longevity, and their reproductive performance. The results showed that L. trifolii females laid fewer eggs on the upper leaves, which were poor hosts for larvae. However, a comparison of oviposition behavior between the middle and lower leaves showed that the data did not fit the oviposition preference–offspring performance hypothesis, which postulates that females preferentially oviposit on hosts on which larvae perform best. Females exhibited a preference for the larger, older, lower leaves, although the middle leaves were superior for the growth and development of the young stages. It is hypothesized that adult ovipositional preference for the older, larger, and thicker leaves of the lower foliage may be influenced by factors other than resource quality for larvae.},

	abstract = {This review discusses the prevalence and potential for interactive effects between herbivory and competition on plant growth and biomass, and it is apparent that such effects typically arise when there is a mismatch between the spatial scale of herbivore behaviour (food or patch choice) and the spatial heterogeneity of the plant community. Historically, such interactive effects have been examined using two approaches. Studies using the first approach have excluded plant neighbors and herbivores in a factorial experiment, and scored effects on plant biomass. Studies using the second approach have observed herbivore abundance or herbivory on plants with or without plant neighbors, and have identified a large number of mechanisms underlying such interactive effects. The two types of studies have produced somewhat conflicting results, where interactive effects have been commonly observed in studies using the second approach and only rarely in studies using the first approach. This is most likely a consequence of a biased choice of study systems, where studies using the first approach have primarily studied mammalian herbivory while studies using the second approach have been more focussed on insect herbivory. Moreover, studies using the first approach have typically been very small-scale manipulations and this probably precludes most possible interactive effects in systems with mammalian herbivory. This points to the fact that studies examining interactive effects of herbivory and plant competition should more carefully consider the behaviour and life history of herbivores included in the study prior to the design of removal experiments.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT The annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana is widely used as a model system in molecular genetics, but little is known about populations in the field. In this experimental field study of natural populations of Arabidopsis, I tested the assumption that plant resistance has fitness costs. Models of the evolution of resistance assume a cost, which is envisioned as a reduction in fitness in the absence of natural enemies, such as insect herbivores and pathogens. The presumed basis of this cost is the diversion of limiting resources away from present and future growth and reproduction. Recent failures to detect allocation costs of resistance to herbivores have raised questions about whether costs exist and, thus, about the appropriateness of theories that postulate such costs. I found genetic variation for two traits commonly thought to function as resistance characters: trichome density and total glucosinolate concentration. Under field conditions, these characters both reduced damage by the natural assemblage of herbivores and exhibited significant fitness costs.},

	abstract = {BackgroundMany of the processes affecting genetic diversity act on local populations. However, studies of plant nucleotide diversity have largely ignored local sampling, making it difficult to infer the demographic history of populations and to assess the importance of local adaptation. Arabidopsis lyrata, a self-incompatible, perennial species with a circumpolar distribution, is an excellent model system in which to study the roles of demographic history and local adaptation in patterning genetic variation.Principal FindingsWe studied nucleotide diversity in six natural populations of Arabidopsis lyrata, using 77 loci sampled from 140 chromosomes. The six populations were highly differentiated, with a median FST of 0.52, and structure analysis revealed no evidence of admixed individuals. Average within-population diversity varied among populations, with the highest diversity found in a German population; this population harbors 3-fold higher levels of silent diversity than worldwide samples of A. thaliana. All A. lyrata populations also yielded positive values of Tajima's D. We estimated a demographic model for these populations, finding evidence of population divergence over the past 19,000 to 47,000 years involving non-equilibrium demographic events that reduced the effective size of most populations. Finally, we used the inferred demographic model to perform an initial test for local adaptation and identified several genes, including the flowering time gene FCA and a disease resistance locus, as candidates for local adaptation events.ConclusionsOur results underscore the importance of population-specific, non-equilibrium demographic processes in patterning diversity within A. lyrata. Moreover, our extensive dataset provides an important resource for future molecular population genetic studies of local adaptation in A. lyrata.},

The plants in the model play either a defensive or a non-defensive strategy and they interact indirectly: when a plant is grazed its competitive ability decreases, because of this a neighboring plant makes a profit. The solution to the game leads to three qualitatively different cases depending on whether the profit is equal for the two strategies, defended and undefended, or if the profit is higher for one type than for the other. When the results are applied to intea-specific interactions, the model predicts that polymorphic populations should be expected only under certain specific conditions.

A survey of the literature reveals that mean Qst is typically larger than and poorly correlated with mean Fst across 29 species. Within species, Qst varies widely among traits; traits experiencing the strongest local selection pressures are expected to be the most divergent from molecular Fst. Thus, Qst will be particularly relevant to conservation efforts where preserving extant adaptation to local environments is an important goal. Recent theoretical and simulation studies suggest however that Fst is a better predictor of the pattern of allelic differentiation at quantitative trait loci (QTLs) than is Qst in random mating populations, in which case allelic variation at QTLs might be better assessed by molecular markers than will extant variation in the traits themselves.},

Exposure of the larvae themselves to ambient UV-B under a soybeancanopy during the feeding trials did not lower their life expectancy. At thewhole canopy level, we found that solar UV-B exclusion resulted in a two-foldincrease in the number of leaf lesions inflicted by various species of chewinginsects that naturally invaded the field plots. Leaves from canopies exposed tosolar UV-B showed significantly higher levels of soluble phenolics and lowerlevels of lignin than leaves that developed in canopies covered by polyesterfilms. No differences in specific leaf mass, leaf nitrogen or hemicellulosecontent were detected between the control and the solar-UV-B exclusiontreatments.

Insect communities on 26 species of manzanita Arctostaphylos spp. (Ericaceae) were sampled in order to examine the effects of variation in foliar pubescence traits on a community of folivorous insects. Manzanitas vary widely in pubescence density, length, and glandularity both within and between species.2. Linear models were fitted and evaluated to determine whether pubescence traits are associated with the species richness and abundance of folivorous insects after accounting for the effects of other relevant habitat and host-plant related characteristics.3. Pubescence traits were clearly associated with both community-wide and guild-specific variation in the structure of the folivorous insect community of manzanitas, however the effects of pubescence were manifested primarily as effects on the abundance of folivores not on species richness. The species richness of folivorous insects on manzanitas was not associated with pubescence density or length but was associated positively with glandularity.4. The abundance of all guilds except leaf-mining insects was lower on manzanitas having longer pubescence. In contrast, the abundance of external-chewing insects was higher on plants having denser pubescence and on plants having glandular pubescence.5. Overall, the results suggest that both longer pubescence and the amount of contact between an insect and pubescence act quantitatively to decrease the abundance of external-feeding guilds of folivorous insects. The abundance of species in internal-feeding guilds that oviposit directly on leaves is unrelated to foliar pubescence traits in the host plant.},

The role of aphid infestation level and duration, systemic production of volatiles by “insect-free” parts of the plant, and the specificity of aphid-induced volatiles on the flight behavior of the foraging female parasitoids were investigated. The upper insect-free part of a three-leaved broad bean plant, which was basally infested by a population of 40 A. pisum, released synomones detectable by A. ervi females after at least 48–72 hr of infestation, resulting in both significant increases in oriented flights and landings on the source compared with uninfested control plants. This suggests that volatiles involved in host-location by A. ervi are systemically released by broad bean plants either in response to circulation of aphid saliva, circulation of saliva-induced bioactive elicitors, or circulation of the synomones themselves. Air entrainment extracts of volatiles collected from a broad bean plant infested by the nonhost Aphis fabae or an uninfested broad bean plant elicited few oriented flights and landing responses by female parasitoids. These extracts were significantly less attractive than extracts collected from a broad bean plant infested by the host A. pisum, indicating the specificity of synomones elicited by different aphid species on the same plant species.},

	abstract = {The C3–C4 hypothesis states that plants possessing the C4 photosynthetic pathway are a poorer food resource for herbivores than those possessing the C3 pathway, and that this difference is reflected in a tendency for herbivores to avoid feeding on C4 species. We tested this hypothesis by studying host preference of two oligophagous grass miners, Chromatomyia milii and C. nigra (Diptera: Agromyzidae). Multiple-choice experiments between four C3 and four C4 grasses, two-choice experiments between combinations of C3 and C4 grasses, and no-choice experiments demonstrated a clear feeding and oviposition preference for C3 grasses by both miners. Feeding and oviposition were very rare to absent on all C4 grasses. Nutritional-quality analyses showed that water, protein, amino acid, and lignin content did not differ between C3 and C4 grasses; only the soluble carbohydrate content proved to be significantly lower in C4 grasses. We postulated and tested a new explanation for C4 avoidance, the “physical-constraint hypothesis,” which states that physical constraints imposed by a smaller interveinal distance in C4 grasses may cause C4 avoidance. Interveinal distances of C4 grasses were significantly smaller than those of C3 grasses, and their ranges did not overlap. Several observations strongly suggested that interveinal distance influences feeding and oviposition patterns. Firstly, the ovipositor and eggs of both miners were too wide to fit between two adjacent veins of C4 grasses. Secondly, feeding punctures initiated on C4 grasses were smaller than on C3 grasses, and feeding-puncture size was correlated with interveinal distance. Regression analysis showed that feeding and oviposition preference were positively related to interveinal distance but not to carbohydrate content. We conclude that our observations are consistent with the physical-constraint hypothesis rather than the nutritional-quality hypothesis.},

Seed size was positively associated with fruit size, which was, in turn, positively correlated with twig diameter, but negatively correlated with the ratio of twig length to diameter. The effect of twig size on seed size variation was not significant, possibly as a result of the large variation in seed number per fruit. Cross-species and across-phyletic divergence analyses revealed that seed size was negatively and isometrically correlated with seed number per twig mass in both the evergreen and deciduous species groupings, demonstrating the existence of tradeoff between seed size and number.• A seed size vs number tradeoff is detectable in the twigs of woody species.

Previous studies revealed that galls are induced not on feeding site but on distant, newly extended leaves during the feeding, and strongly suggested that some chemicals injected by the leafhopper affect at the leaf primordia. To approach the mechanism underlying gall induction by C. bipunctata, we examined physiological response of plants to feeding by the leafhopper. We performed high-throughput and comprehensive plant hormone analyses using LC-ESI-MS/MS. Galled maize leaves contained higher contents of abscisic acid (ABA) and trans-Zeatin (tZ) and lower contents of gibberellins (GA1 and GA4) than ungalled maize leaves. Leafhopper treatment significantly increased ABA and tZ contents and decreased GA1 and GA4 contents in extending leaves. After the removal of leafhoppers, contents of tZ and gibberellins in extending leaves soon became similar to the control values. ABA content was gradually decreased after the removal of leafhoppers. Such hormonal changes were not observed in leafhopper treatment on leaves of resistant maize variety. Water contents of galled leaves were significantly lower than control leaves, suggesting water stress of galled leaves and possible reason of the increase in ABA content. These results imply that ABA, tZ, and gibberellins are related to gall induction by the leafhopper on susceptible variety of maize.},

	abstract = {Ontogenetic changes in leaf chemistry can affect plant–herbivore interactions profoundly. Various theoretical models predict different ontogenetic trajectories of defence chemicals. Empirical tests do not consistently support one model. In Eucalyptus nitens, a fast-growing tree, we assessed early developmental changes to seedlings, in foliage concentrations of nitrogen and the full suite of known secondary (defence) chemicals. This included the terpene, α-pinene, whose impact on marsupial herbivory is unknown. To test for the influence of abiotic conditions on the ontogenetic trajectories we overlaid a nutrient treatment. Ontogenetic trajectories varied among compounds. Sideroxylonals and cineole were barely detected in very young seedlings, but increased substantially over the first 200 days. Total phenolic concentration increased fourfold over this time. In contrast, α-pinene concentration peaked within the first 60 days and again between 150 and 200 days. Nutrients altered the degree but not the direction of change of most chemicals. A shorter trial run at a different season showed qualitatively similar patterns, although α-pinene concentration started very high. We investigated the effect of detected levels of α-pinene and cineole on food intake by two mammalian herbivores, common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) and red-bellied pademelons (Thylogale billardierii). Under no-choice conditions neither terpene reduced intake; but with a choice, possums preferred α-pinene to cineole. The ontogenetic trajectories of most compounds were therefore consistent with models that predict an increase as plants develop. Published data from later developmental stages in E. nitens also confirm this pattern. α-Pinene, however, was the only secondary compound found at significant levels in very young seedlings; but it did not constrain feeding by marsupial herbivores. Models must allow for different roles of defensive secondary chemicals, presumably associated with different selective pressures as plants age, which result in different ontogenetic trajectories.},

But it is difficult to observe the time-lagged oscillations between host and parasite genotypes that should result from FDS. To evaluate the potential for FDS, we tested for local adaptation of parasites to common clones, the role of host genetic diversity in resistance to parasites, and genetic correlations among fitness, parasitism, and the frequency of host clones. We studied three populations of Arabis holboellii, a short-lived apomictic (asexual by seed) plant attacked by rust fungi and insect herbivores. To estimate clone frequency, we used polymorphic allozyme markers on 200 individuals in each population in 1990 and in 2000. We also recorded levels of parasitism and host fitness (fruit production). Only the rust fungi showed evidence for local host adaptation; they usually increased in incidence as a function of clone frequency, and they tracked temporal change in clone frequency. In further support of FDS, parasitism was lower in populations with higher genetic diversity. However, total parasitism (herbivory and disease combined) decreased as host clone frequency and fitness increased. Thus, although the highly virulent rust pathogen showed potential for driving the cycles that result from FDS, this apparently does not occur in the populations studied because the host clones were also attacked by herbivores.},

In diverse forests, herbivory by oligophagous species was virtually always reduced, whereas the response of polyphagous species was variable. Further analyses revealed that the composition of tree mixtures may be more important than species richness per se because diversity effects on herbivory were greater when mixed forests comprised taxonomically more distant tree species, and when the proportion of non-host trees was greater than that of host trees.

	abstract = {Anthropogenic noise is becoming a dominant component of soundscapes across the world and these altered acoustic conditions may have severe consequences for natural communities. We modeled noise amplitudes from gas well compressors across a 16 km 2 study area to estimate the influence of noise on avian habitat use and nest success. Using species with noise responses representative of other avian community members, across the study area we estimated gray flycatcher ( Empidonax wrightii) and western scrub-jay ( Aphelocoma californica ) occupancy, and gray flycatcher nest success, which is highly dependent on predation by western scrub-jays. We also explore how alternative noise management and mitigation scenarios may reduce area impacted by noise. Compressor noise affected 84.5\% of our study area and occupancy of each species was approximately 5\% lower than would be expected without compressor noise. In contrast, flycatcher nest success was 7\% higher, reflecting a decreased rate of predation in noisy areas. Not all alternative management and mitigation scenarios reduced the proportion of area affected by noise; however, use of sound barrier walls around compressors could reduce the area affected by noise by 70\% and maintain occupancy and nest success rates at levels close to those expected in a landscape without compressor noise. These results suggest that noise from compressors could be effectively managed and, because habitat use and nest success are only two of many ecological processes that may change with noise exposure, minimizing the anthropogenic component of soundscapes should be a conservation priority.},

	abstract = {Abstract. That variation in the water and nutrient content of plant tissues affects allelochemical toxicity to insects is well established. However, little is known about how these dietary constituents influence allelochemical deterrency. In vertebrates, deterrency of particular allelochemicals increases with dietary water, and decreases with an increase in dietary nutrients. We determined if these findings were relevant to phytophagous insects through an experimental design that allowed us to vary independently the content of water (70–90\% fresh mass, fm, with nutrient level at 10\% fm) and nutrients (10–30\% fm with water level at 70\% or 80\% fm) in an artificial diet through use of alphacel, a non-nutritive cellulose fibre. We examined the effect of these dietary manipulations on allelochemical deterrency by comparing larval feeding responses of two noctuid species, the oligophagous Anticarsia gemmatalis Hübner and the polyphagous Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith), to a control diet and an allelochemical-treated diet in two consecutive, no-choice tests. These tests were restricted to 3 min to minimize post-ingestive influences. From an initial twelve compounds tested, all but two were excluded for the following reasons: (i) failure to elicit an intermediate level of deterrency at {\textbackslash}textless1\% fm (i.e. albizziin, amygdalin, hordenine, ouabain, pipecolic acid, salicin, sinigrin and umbelliferone); (ii) an apparently rapid toxic effect (nicotine hydrogen tartrate); and (iii) adsorption to alphacel (quinine hydrochloride), which may have reduced deterrency. The deterrency of caffeine and linamarin increased with dietary water but was unaffected by nutrient content for both species. The similar results for an alkaloid and a cyanogenic glycoside, with two species differing considerably in feeding habits, suggest that dietary water is likely to influence the defensive efficacy of a broader range of deterrent allelochemicals to a variety of plant-feeding insects.},

	abstract = {Induced plant defenses in response to herbivore attack are modulated by cross-talk between jasmonic acid (JA)- and salicylic acid (SA)-signaling pathways. Oral secretions from some insect herbivores contain effectors that overcome these antiherbivore defenses. Herbivores possess diverse microbes in their digestive systems and these microbial symbionts can modify plant–insect interactions; however, the specific role of herbivore-associated microbes in manipulating plant defenses remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) larvae exploit bacteria in their oral secretions to suppress antiherbivore defenses in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). We found that antibiotic-untreated larvae decreased production of JA and JA-responsive antiherbivore defenses, but increased SA accumulation and SA-responsive gene expression. Beetles benefit from down-regulating plant defenses by exhibiting enhanced larval growth. In SA-deficient plants, suppression was not observed, indicating that suppression of JA-regulated defenses depends on the SA-signaling pathway. Applying bacteria isolated from larval oral secretions to wounded plants confirmed that three microbial symbionts belonging to the genera Stenotrophomonas, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacter are responsible for defense suppression. Additionally, reinoculation of these bacteria to antibiotic-treated larvae restored their ability to suppress defenses. Flagellin isolated from Pseudomonas sp. was associated with defense suppression. Our findings show that the herbivore exploits symbiotic bacteria as a decoy to deceive plants into incorrectly perceiving the threat as microbial. By interfering with the normal perception of herbivory, beetles can evade antiherbivore defenses of its host.},

(Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Lemini), is found in greater numbers, and lays more eggs, on later planted (younger) oats (Avena sativa L.) (Poaceae). Plant characteristics that could explain this ovipositional preference were examined in a series of experiments. Cage and open field whole plant preference tests confirmed the attraction of ovipositing females to younger oats. A cage effect illustrated the role of plant architecture (plant height) in CLB host selection. Two multiple-choice and one no-choice excised leaf experiments determined that characteristics of individual leaves associated with leaf insertion level (leaf number from base to apex) and age influence ovipositional site selection. Leaves of higher insertion level have higher nitrogen content, but fewer eggs are laid on those leaves. Two experiments examining the interaction between total leaf nitrogen and leaf insertion level showed that only leaf insertion level affected oviposition choice. Published literature suggests variation in secondary plant compounds cannot explain O. melanopus ovipositional preference among leaves. Grass leaves of higher insertion level have more extensively developed cells associated with tissue toughness and hardness. The data and supporting literature suggest tissue toughness and hardness are deterring oviposition on oat leaves of higher insertion level. However, newly eclosed larvae are able to feed on leaves usually avoided as oviposition sites. The explanation for this result may be a lack of correlation between host suitability and ovipositional preference.},

Apostatic selection has often been investigated using fixed relative proportions of prey,, but its effects on predator–prey dynamics have been difficult to demonstrate. Here we report results from a new technique that incorporates computer-generated displays, into an established experimental system, that of blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) hunting for cryptic Catocala moths. Digital prey images from a virtual population are presented to predators. The relative numbers that escape detection determine the subsequent abundance of each prey type. If apostatic selection does promote stability, the system should converge on an eqlibrium in which each prey type appears at a characteristic abundance.

	abstract = {Natural selection can drive the repeated evolution of reproductive isolation, but the genomic basis of parallel speciation remains poorly understood. We analyzed whole-genome divergence between replicate pairs of stick insect populations that are adapted to different host plants and undergoing parallel speciation. We found thousands of modest-sized genomic regions of accentuated divergence between populations, most of which are unique to individual population pairs. We also detected parallel genomic divergence across population pairs involving an excess of coding genes with specific molecular functions. Regions of parallel genomic divergence in nature exhibited exceptional allele frequency changes between hosts in a field transplant experiment. The results advance understanding of biological diversification by providing convergent observational and experimental evidence for selection’s role in driving repeatable genomic divergence. Stick to the Bush Can the underlying genetic changes driving the divergence of populations into new species be predicted or repeated? Soria-Carrasco et al. (p. 738) investigated the genetic changes observed after one generation when stick insect (Timema cristinae) populations were transplanted from their preferred host plants to alternative hosts. Diverged genetic regions were relatively small, with most loci showing divergence in a single population pair. However, the number of loci showing parallel divergence was greater than expected by chance. Thus, selection can drive parallel phenotypic evolution via parallel genetic changes.},

	abstract = {This study examined the daily activity patterns of the pollinators of Lavandula latifolia (Labiatae), a summer-flowering, insect-pollinated evergreen shrub of Mediterranean woodlands. The question is addressed, What is the degree of matching between the daily floral cycle of L. latifolia and the daily profile of pollinating potential of its pollinator assemblage? L. latifolia open flowers and produce nectar uninterruptedly over daytime, and both flower production and nectar secretion rates are highest early in the morning and late in the afternoon. Pollen availability in the flower population, as estimated by the proportion of pollen-bearing, male-phase flowers, reaches a maximum in late afternoon, while nectar and sugar availability peak around the middle of the day. There was considerable variation both among major groups (hymenopterans, dipterans, lepidopterans), and among species within groups, in the timing of foraging at flowers. As a consequence of this, and of interspecific differences in pollen transfer effectiveness and average flight distance between consecutively visited flowers, the daytime period is not homogeneous with regard to the potential pollinating effectiveness of the pollinators active at a given time. There is not, however, a good correlation between the daily cycles of floral resource production and availability, on one hand, and of components of pollinating effectiveness, on the other. It is suggested that both the plant's and the pollinators' daily cycles largely represent independent responses to diel rhythmicity of the physical environment, and that matches and mismatches found here between daily patterns of floral resources and aspects of pollinating effectiveness are epiphenomena lacking particular adaptive significance to the plant.},

	abstract = {Ecologists are faced with the challenge of how to scale up from the activities of individual plants and animals to the macroscopic dynamics of populations and communities. It is especially difficult to do this in communities of plants where the fate of individuals depends on their immediate neighbors rather than an average over a larger region. This has meant that algorithmic, agent-based models are typically used to understand their dynamics, although certain macroscopic models have been developed for neighbor-dependent, birth–death processes. Here we present a macroscopic model that, for the first time, incorporates explicit, gradual, neighbor-dependent plant growth, as a third fundamental process of plant communities. The model is derived from a stochastic, agent-based model, and describes the dynamics of the first and second spatial moments of a multispecies, spatially structured plant community with neighbor-dependent growth, births, and deaths. A simple example shows that strong neighborhood space-filling during tree growth in an even-aged stand of Scots pine is well captured by the spatial-moment model. The space-filling has a spatial signature consistent with that observed in several field studies of forests. Small neighborhoods of interaction, nonuniform spacing of trees, and asymmetric competition all contribute to the buildup of a wide range of tree sizes with some large dominant individuals and many smaller ones.},

We investigated these effects by carrying out a meta-analysis of 320 case studies of correlations between plant and animal species richnesses. The diversity of arthropods, herps, birds, and mammals significantly increased with plant diversity regardless of species habitat. However, correlations were stronger when plant and animal species richnesses were compared between habitats (γ diversity) than within single habitats (α diversity). For arthropods, both the coefficient of correlation and the slope of the regression line were also greater for primary than for secondary consumers. These findings substantiate the use of plant species richness as an indicator of the diversity of animal taxa over space.},

	abstract = {In contrast to many arthropods whose locomotion on plant surfaces is impeded by trichomes, the omnivorous mirid bug Dicyphus errans Wolff (Heteroptera, Miridae, Bryocorinae) lives on pubescent plants and preys on a variety of phytophagous arthropods. Morphological (slim body, long slender legs, elongated curved claws) and behavioural (locomotion) adaptations to hairy plant substrates result in higher predation effectiveness and fecundity, as well as a shorter developmental cycle of the bug compared to insects on plants without trichomes. To understand the bug–plant interactions from the biomechanical point of view, the bug’s attachment system and the leaf surfaces of various plant species were analysed. Bug attachment ability was estimated in an inversion experiment on the adaxial and abaxial sides of leaves in 40 plant species. Furthermore, bug traction forces on the abaxial leaf side of 14 plant species were measured. Morphometrical variables of trichomes and the adhesive properties of plant surfaces were estimated. The bugs’ traction force ranged from 0.07 mN on Brassica oleracea (Brassicaceae) to 1.21 mN on Plectranthus ambiguus (Lamiaceae) and Solanum melongena (Solanaceae). Bugs performed considerably better on hairy surfaces where a significant positive correlation between the force and both the trichome length and diameter was found. The trichome density and aspect ratio did not influence the force. Adhesion properties of plant surfaces covered with trichomes may also significantly impede the traction force. Based on the results obtained, it is concluded that hairy plants provide a more suitable environment for D. errans than either smooth ones or those covered with wax crystals. Hairy plant surfaces are predicted to support stronger attachment and therefore more reliable locomotion of the bug.},

A number of root-hair and leaf-trichome patterning mutants and tools for cell-specific and tissue-specific manipulation of patterning protein activities have been combined in cycles of experimentation and mathematical modelling. These approaches have provided insight into molecular mechanisms of epidermal patterning. During the last two years, endoreplication has, unexpectedly, been found to control cell-fate maintenance during trichome patterning. New genetic interactions between a downstream, positive transcriptional regulator and lateral inhibitors of trichome or non-root-hair fate specification have been uncovered. A lateral inhibitor and a new positive regulator have been identified as major loci affecting trichome patterning in natural Arabidopsis populations. Finally, factors that modify root-hair patterning from the underlying cell layer have been discovered.},

	abstract = {Some plants can compensate, and even overcompensate, for the loss of productivity caused by herbivory. The presence of latent meristems, or dormant buds, is one of the basic prerequisites of such compensation mechanisms. We present a mathematical model in order to analyze compensation responses in relation to the intensity of herbivory. The model generates a number of qualitatively different kinds of compensation curves when seed production is plotted against the proportion of active meristems lost per grazed plant. The shape of the curves depends on the proportion of dormant buds and their activation sensitivity in relation to meristem loss. Overcompensation is most probable when dormant buds are easily activated. When plants are grazed only once, as assumed in our model, selection favors high bud sensitivity. However, we expect that repeated damage may select for a more restrained pattern of bud activation. When relatively few buds remain dormant, plants can overcompensate for low levels of damage only. On the other hand, when most buds remain dormant, they can overcompensate even for high levels of damage. We consider compensation capacity a potential benefit of bud dormancy when plants are subject to damage. However, bud dormancy may also imply costs on plant productivity and fecundity in the absence of herbivory. Still, intense herbivory may favor bud dormancy in spite of the potential costs. Selection for bud dormancy requires both that the risk of herbivory is high and that herbivores remove a large fraction of active meristems per plant. Consequently, overcompensation is a theoretically plausible possibility, and intense herbivory is a potential selective force that favors bud dormancy. None of these results, however, imply that herbivory is beneficial to plants. In our case, plants with bud dormancy never have higher seed production than plants that have no dormant buds and that are not grazed.},

We analysed 79 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers in 142 accessions from the species’ native range, and found highly significant genetic isolation by distance among A. thaliana accessions from Eurasia and southern Europe. These spatial patterns of genetic variation suggest that A. thaliana colonized central and northern Europe from Asia and from Mediterranean Pleistocene refugia, a trend which has been identified in other species. Statistically significant levels of multilocus linkage disequilibrium suggest intermediate levels of disequilibrium among subsets of loci, and analysis of genetic relationships among accessions reveal a star or bush-like dendrogram with low bootstrap support. Taken together, it appears that there has been sufficient historical recombination in the A. thaliana genome such that accessions do not conform to a tree-like, bifurcating pattern of evolution – there is no ‘ecotype phylogeny.’ Nonetheless, significant isolation by distance provides a framework upon which studies of natural variation in A. thaliana may be designed and interpreted.},

Little is currently known of how herbivores may mediate competitive and facilitative interactions between invasive and native populations of plant species and their plant neighbors. Here, we conducted a common-garden field experiment to test whether invasive and native populations of Brassica nigra differ in phenotypic expressions of growth (biomass and plant height) and reproductive (seed yield) traits under different plant neighbor treatments and ambient vs. reduced level of insect herbivore damage on the B. nigra plants. We found significant interactive effects of plant neighbor treatments, level of insect herbivore damage on B. nigra plants, and invasive status of B. nigra on the phenotypic trait expressions. Plant neighbor treatments had minimal effects on phenotypic trait expressions by invasive populations of B. nigra under either level of insect herbivore damage. In contrast, for native populations of B. nigra, ambient level of insect herbivore damage resulted in plant neighbors facilitating expression of the traits above, while reduced damage resulted in plant neighbors competitively suppressing trait expression. Our results suggest that insect herbivores and plant neighbors interactively shape expression of plant traits in native and exotic ranges of invasive plants. Such interactions could potentially lead to different selection pressures on traits that determine antiherbivore defenses and plant–plant interactions.},

	abstract = {We tested for variation in the intensity of above- and belowground competition along a 5-yr-old experimental gradient of nitrogen availability in a Minnesota old field. Standing crop increased, species richness decreased, and species composition varied significantly as nitrogen availability increased. Transplants of the three grasses that were dominants at the three levels of the nitrogen gradient (low; Schizachyrium scoparium, intermediate: Poa pratensis, high: Agropyron repens) were grown along the gradient with no neighbors present, with only the roots of neighbors present, or with both the roots and shoots of neighbors present. Resource measurements indicated that the treatment with only neighbor roots present provided at light regime similar to that in which all neighbors had been removed but a nitrogen regime similar to that in which all neighbors were present. At low nitrogen availability, transplants grown with only neighbor roots generally did not differ significantly in biomass or growth rate from those grown with both neighbor roots and shoots, suggesting that the bulk of neighbor effects at low nitrogen were belowground. At high nitrogen availability, plants grown with only neighbor roots generally grew significantly larger than those grown with both roots and shoots of neighbors, but not as large as plants grown with no neighbors, suggesting that both above- and belowground competition occurred. At low nitrogen availability, plants grown with neighbors weighed 3-12\% as much as those grown without; at the highest rate of nitrogen addition, plants grown with neighbors weighed 12-58\% as much as those grown without, indicating that competition occurred on both poor and rich soils. The intensity of competition, measured as the suppression of transplants by neighbors, did not vary significantly with nitrogen availability. Further, the per-gram effect of neighbors, measured as the slope of the relationship between transplant performance and neighbor biomass, did not vary significantly with nitrogen supply rate. In total, competition was an important force at all points along the experimental productivity gradient, but competition shifted from being mainly belowground in the least productive vegetation to both above- and belowground in fertilized plots.},

We researched the loss of SI in a phylogeographic context. We used cpDNA and microsatellite markers to test if populations of North-American A. lyrata around the Great Lakes have experienced different (recent) histories, and linked this with individually established selfing phenotype and population level realized outcrossing rates calculated based on variation in progeny arrays at multi-locus microsatellite markers. We found three chloroplast haplotypes, in two of which the loss of self-incompatibility had occurred independently. Shifts to high rates of inbreeding were most apparent in one of these lineages but individuals showing loss of SI occurred in all three. Self-compatible individuals usually showed a reduction of observed heterozygosity (HO) compared to outcrossing individuals. In the lineage that included the populations with the highest levels of inbreeding, this reduction was more substantial. This may indicate that the loss of SI in this lineage did not occur as recently as in the other lineage. The geographic distribution of the haplotypes suggested that there had been at least two independent colonization routes to the north of the Great Lakes following the last glaciation. This is consistent with postglacial migration patterns that have been suggested for other organisms with limited dispersal, such as reptiles and amphibians.},

	abstract = {Plant defense theories predict that allocation to antiherbivore defenses should impose a cost on plants, manifested as a reduction in growth and reproduction. However, the empirical evidence for the existence of such trade-offs is conflicting, suggesting that significant fitness costs of defense arise in some circumstances but not in others. A meta-analysis of 70 studies assessing the relationship between measures of plant defense and growth or reproduction has been conducted to examine the relative importance of several potential sources of variation in the fitness costs of defense. The magnitude of fitness costs varied depending on whether they were measured at the level of phenotype or genotype. The mean magnitude of among-genotype correlations (AGCs) between defense and fitness measures (r =-0.30) was higher than that of among-phenotype correlations (APCs; r =-0.15). Moreover, AGCs tended to be more negative when defense was assessed as the inverse of herbivore densities or damage rather than in terms of single specific chemical or structural traits. The magnitude of APCs was greatly influenced by environmental variation; phenotypic costs were lowest under controlled experimental. conditions and highest in studies that minimized genetic variation among plants. In addition, the magnitude and sign of APCs varied depending on nutrient availability and the type of defensive compound. APCs were negative at high levels of nutrient availability and for defenses associated with alkaloids and phenolics but tended to be positive at low levels of nutrient availability and for defenses associated with terpenoids. In contrast, the magnitude of fitness costs was not significantly affected by the presence of herbivores, type of plant, type of defense (constitutive, mechanical, or induced), concentrations of defensive compounds, or measure of plant fitness. The above patterns of variation in the magnitude of correlations between defense and fitness measures are inconsistent with the notion that fitness costs are incurred through diversion of common limited resources from growth and reproduction to defense (allocation costs). Instead, the prevalence of significant negative correlations under uncontrolled environmental conditions and their persistence in the presence of herbivores both imply that fitness costs of defense may often arise through interactions between plants and their abiotic and biotic environment (competitors, pollinators, different types of herbivores, their natural enemies, and various types of abiotic stresses). Because the above aspects have usually been excluded in studies aiming at detecting internal allocation trade-offs, the failure to detect costs in some cases may be a consequence of the experimental design. Future studies should examine the relative importance of opportunity and ecological types of costs by manipulating various aspects of plant environment.},

	abstract = {Close spatial relationships between plant species are often important for defense against herbivory. The associational plant defense may have important implications for plant community structure, species diversity, and species coexistence. An increasing number of studies have focused on associational plant defense against herbivory at the scale of the individual plant and its nearest neighbors. However, the average neighborhood effects between plant species at the scale of whole plant communities have received almost no attention. The aims of this study were to determine patterns of spatial relationship between different plant species that can provide effective defense against herbivory. We conducted a manipulative experiment using sheep and three native plant species with different palatability. Consumption of palatable plants by herbivores was largest when the three plant species were isolated in three patches and independent of each other. A homogenous and spatially equal neighbor relationship between the three species did not reduce the risk of herbivory of palatable species compared to isolation of these species, but it reduced the total intake of all plant species. The palatable species was subject to less herbivory in a complex spatial neighborhood of several plant species. High complexity of spatial neighborhood resulted in herbivores passively reducing selectivity, thereby reducing the probability of damage to palatable species in the community, or making inaccurate judgments in foraging selectivity between and within patches, thereby reducing the vulnerability of palatable plants and even the whole plant community. We conclude that compelling herbivores to passively reduce the magnitude of foraging selectivity by establishing spatially complex neighborhoods between plant species is a compromise and optimal spatial strategy by plants to defend themselves again herbivory. This may contribute not only to maintenance of plant species diversity but also to a stable coexistence between herbivores and plants in grassland ecosystems.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/3069259},
	abstract = {An important aim of plant ecology is to identify leading dimensions of ecological variation among species and to understand the basis for them. Dimensions that can readily be measured would be especially useful, because they might offer a path towards improved worldwide synthesis across the thousands of field experiments and ecophysiological studies that use just a few species each. Four dimensions are reviewed here. The leaf mass per area-leaf lifespan (LMA-LL) dimension expresses slow turnover of plant parts (at high LMA and long LL), long nutrient residence times, and slow response to favorable growth conditions. The seed mass-seed output (SM-SO) dimension is an important predictor of dispersal to establishment opportunities (seed output) and of establishment success in the face of hazards (seed mass). The LMA-LL and SM-SO dimensions are each underpinned by a single, comprehensible tradeoff, and their consequences are fairly well understood. The leaf size-twig size (LS-TS) spectrum has obvious consequences for the texture of canopies, but the costs and benefits of large versus small leaf and twig size are poorly understood. The height dimension has universally been seen as ecologically important and included in ecological strategy schemes. Nevertheless, height includes several tradeoffs and adaptive elements, which ideally should be treated separately. Each of these four dimensions varies at the scales of climate zones and of site types within landscapes. This variation can be interpreted as adaptation to the physical environment. Each dimension also varies widely among coexisting species. Most likely this within-site variation arises because the ecological opportunities for each species depend strongly on which other species are present, in other words, because the set of species at a site is a stable mixture of strategies.},

To evaluate its potential as a biological control agent in the United States, we conducted experiments on the host-specificity and impact on the target weed in China. The host range was tested on 78 plant species in 21 families through no-choice larval development tests and field surveys. The results showed that G. inexacta could only complete development on T. sebifera, T. rotundifolia and T. chihsinianum, suggesting a narrow host range. Attack by G. inexacta larvae significantly reduced the growth of seedlings of T. sebifera and the impact was greater when the plant was repeatedly defoliated and in shaded conditions. The plants were entirely defoliated after being repeatedly damaged in the treatments of the highest larval density (six larvae per seedling) in shade, causing 80\% seedling mortality and the total biomass was reduced to 60\% of the control. The results of this study suggested that G. inexacta may be a suitable biological control agent of T. sebifera though further tests on native North American species are needed.},

By feeding from a variety of plants that contain different classes of PSMs, animals can use multiple detoxification pathways and presumably consume more food. Although popular, this theory is difficult to test because it requires knowledge of the detoxification pathways of each PSM in the diet. We established that common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) use various combinations of oxidation, hydrolysis, and conjugation with glucuronic acid (GA) or glycine to detoxify six PSMs. Compared to their ingestion of a single PSM, possums ate more when offered a choice between two diets containing PSMs that require apparently independent detoxification pathways (benzoate and 1,8-cineole, benzoate and p-cymene, benzoate and orcinol, benzoate and salicin, or orcinol and 1,8-cineole). However, possums still did not eat as much of these diets as they did of a basal diet free of PSMs. This suggests that detoxification pathways are never independent, but are separated instead by degrees. In contrast, possums offered a choice of two PSMs that require competing detoxification pathways (1,8-cineole and p-cymene, 1,8-cineole and salicin, or orcinol and salicin) ate no more than when offered diets containing one of the compounds. There was an exception: even though both rutin and orcinol are detoxified via conjugation with GA, the feeding behavior of possums did not suggest competition for detoxification pathways. This implies that the supply of GA is not limiting. This study provides the first convincing evidence that herbivorous mammals can eat more by selecting mixed diets with a diversity of PSMs that make full use of their detoxification potential. It also emphasizes that other behavioral and physiological factors, such as transient food aversions, influence feeding behavior.},

We investigated the relationship between specialization and pollination efficiency, defined as the proportion of pollinated flowers relative to those that experienced pollen removal, using orchids with different pollination strategies as a model system. Rewarding orchids showed the highest pollination efficiency. Sexually deceptive orchids had comparably high pollination efficiency, but food‐deceptive orchids had significantly lower efficiency. Values for pollinator sharing (a measure of the degree of generalization in pollination systems) showed the reverse pattern, in that groups with high pollination efficiency had low values of pollinator sharing. Low pollinator sharing may thus be the basis for efficient pollination. Population genetic data indicated that both food‐ and sexually deceptive species have higher degrees of among‐population gene flow than do rewarding orchids. Thus, the shift from food to sexual deception may be driven by selection for more efficient pollination, without compromising the high levels of gene flow that are characteristic of deceptive species.},

In particular, selection exerted by natural enemies could favour host-plant switches and cause, or maintain, oviposition preference for a host species that is nutritionally inferior to another acceptable host. * 2In a previous study, it was shown that larvae of the leaf beetle Oreina elongata perform better on Adenostyles alliariae (Asteraceae) than on Cirsium spinosissimum (Asteraceae). Moreover, A. alliariae provides larval and adult beetles with sequestrable chemical defences. However, in the field, egg densities are much higher on C. spinosissimum than on adjacent A. alliariae. * 3In this study, it was investigated whether this oviposition pattern could be maintained by C. spinosissimum, providing the eggs of O. elongata with better protection from natural enemies. In a field experiment, the survival of eggs was quantified on plants of each of the two species, with and without enemy exclusion. * 4 Egg survival was equal for both host species when enemies were excluded from the plants, but it was higher on C. spinosissimum than on A. alliariae when enemies were allowed to the plants. It was also experimentally tested whether the higher egg densities observed in the field on C. spinosissimum are actually due to oviposition preference by the beetle. In a no-choice test, females laid more eggs on C. spinosissimum than on A. alliariae. * 5 It can thus be confirmed that C. spinosissimum is really preferred for oviposition and it is concluded that this preference is likely to be maintained, at least partly, by a higher egg survival on C. spinosissimum due to enemy-free space provided by this host plant.},

On reefs heavily grazed by sea urchins, benthic macroalgae and invertebrate fish prey were relatively more abundant among Corynactis colonies than adjacent areas lacking the anemone. Results from field experiments showed that Corynactis facilitated the recruitment of macroalgae and tubicolous amphipods in “urchin-barren” areas subjected to intensive grazing. In areas forested by giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), where grazing intensity from urchins was low, Corynactis suppressed algal recruitment but facilitated tubicolous amphipods. A manipulation of fish and sea urchins suggested that grazing by urchins, as opposed to predation from fish (primarily surfperch Embiotocidae), suppressed tubicolous amphipods, and this activity was hindered by the presence of Corynactis. In systems where human activity has intensified herbivory, associational refuges may maintain species diversity and support higher trophic levels.},

	abstract = {The tomato–potato psyllid Bactericera [Paratrioza] cockerelli (Sulc) has recently caused losses exceeding 50\% on fresh market tomatoes in California and Baja, Mexico by injecting a toxin that results in a condition known as ‘psyllid yellows’. The objectives of this study were to: (i) document oviposition preferences on a range of tomato cultivars; (ii) determine threshold levels for psyllid densities that would cause psyllid yellows on tomatoes within the first three weeks following transplanting; and (iii) identify the most important ‘psyllid yellows’ symptoms that might be used in surveying and monitoring for this pest. Plant lines tested included the commonly-planted commercial cultivars ‘Shady Lady’ and ‘QualiT 21’, an older, previously commercial cultivar ‘7718 VFN’, a common cultivar planted by consumers ‘Yellow Pear’, and a wild type plant accession, PI 134417. When given a choice, psyllids significantly preferred ‘Yellow Pear’ and avoided PI 134417 for oviposition. Under no-choice conditions psyllids laid significantly fewer eggs on PI 134417, but all the other plant lines were equally good substrates for laying eggs. Thus, oviposition preference is not likely to provide a functional management strategy in large plantings. On ‘Shady Lady’, psyllids preferred to oviposit on plants already infested with adults. On both ‘Shady Lady’ and ‘7718 VFN’ oviposition was significantly greater on plants previously infested by nymphs as compared to uninfested control plants. This suggests that, at least for some cultivars, there is a physiological change in plant attractiveness following psyllid feeding. ‘Yellow Pear’ and ‘QualiT 21’ were relatively tolerant of psyllids, requiring 18 nymphs per plant to produce the disease symptoms. Only eight nymphs per plant were needed on ‘Shady Lady’ and ‘7718 VFN’. For all cultivars, the pest density showed strong correlations with measurements such as the number of yellowing leaves and leaflets and distorted leaves, which were as good as or better than the first factor extracted from principal component analysis. Therefore, such measurements have the potential to simplify field surveys.},

Previous studies have combined morphological and molecular data to resolve taxonomic questions about geographic distribution of Cercis species, identifying botanical varieties, and associations between morphological variation and the environment. Three species have been used in ornamental plant breeding in the United States, including three botanical varieties of C. canadensis L. from North America and two Asian species, C. chingii Chun and C. chinensis Bunge. In this article, 51 taxa were sampled comprising eight species of Cercis and a closely related species, Bauhinia faberi Oliv. Sixty-eight polymorphic simple sequence repeat markers were used to assess genetic relationships between species and cultivars. For all samples the number of alleles detected ranged from two to 20 and 10 or more alleles were detected at 22 loci. Average polymorphic information content was 0.57 and values ranged from 0.06 to 0.91 with 44 loci 0.50 or greater. Cross-species transfer within Cercis was extremely high with 55 loci that amplified at 100\%. Results support previously reported phylogenetic relationships of the North American and western Eurasian species and indicate suitability of these markers for mapping studies involving C. canadensis and C. chinensis. Results also support known pedigrees from ornamental tree breeding programs for the widely cultivated C. canadensis and C. chinensis species, which comprised the majority of the samples analyzed.},

	url = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040580987900505},
	abstract = {This article investigates some aspects of the shape of the functional responses of consumers that utilize two resources. Adaptive variation in consumption behavior is shown to have a major effect on the relationship between amount of resource available and its rate of consumption by an average consumer individual. The effects of adaptive variation are dependent on the nutritional status of the two resources. If the resources are linearly substitutable, increases in the density of resource i will usually increase the quantity, functional response on i divided by density of i, and increases in the density of resource j will decrease this quantity. The result is that the functional response to resource i will generally decrease with the density of resource j, and will increase faster than it would otherwise have increased with the density of resource i. If resources are nonsubstitutable, an adaptive functional response to resource i will increase with the density of resource j, and it will increase more slowly with the density of resource i than it would have without adaptive change. If resources are both complementary and substitutable, the functional response will exhibit ranges of smooth change separated by rapid jumps between values, and different ranges of resource densities will result in a functional response with the characteristics of linearly substitutable or of non-substitutable resources. Adaptive functional response shape is dependent upon the tradeoff involved in raising each functional response. These results have implications for the types of indirect interactions that occur between resources as the result of a common consumer's functional response. They also suggest that the adaptive response of competing consumers to each other will differ depending on the nutritional status of the resources for which they are competing. Implications of these findings for consumer growth isocline shape and several other issues are explored.},

	abstract = {(1) The dynamics of two populations of Plantago lanceolata from contrasting habitats are simulated with the use of matrix projection models. The fecundity and survival parameters that together form the matrix are based on demographic fieldwork and evaluated for both size and age categories at the same time. (2) After verification of the model, elasticity analysis is applied to determine the model parameters that are most important in defining the population growth rate. The effect of more complex changes in the life histories on the population growth rate is evaluated by means of simulation. (3) The results are in general agreement with expectations based on field observations: seed production is more important in an unpredictable environment, whereas adult survival is more important in a stable environment. In both populations seedling establishment is the most important phase in the life history, especially in the stable habitat. (4) The formation of side rosettes is not so much a mode of vegetative reproduction as a way to increase the current year's seed production in an unpredictable environment. (5) Timing of germination in spring or in autumn is important, but the effect of delay by means of a seedbank is unexpectedly small. (6) The particular form of this matrix projection model is time-invariant. Because fecundity and survival are rarely constant over time, however, random sequences of bad, normal and good years are generated and incorporated in the model. The impact of this variation over time is evaluated using time-to-extinction as a measure.},

We studied florivory in the geometrid moth Chloroclystis excisa utilizing flower buds of a sexually polymorphic shrub, Eurya japonica, to reveal relationships between flower sex and moth oviposition preference, moth larval performance, and plant phenolics composition. In the field, C. excisa exploited flower buds on male and hermaphrodite trees but never those on female trees. In the laboratory, moths showed a strong oviposition preference for male over female flower buds, and larvae did not survive on female buds. Mortality was caused solely by feeding on the calyx covering the female bud. Female calyces contained higher concentrations of total phenolics and condensed tannins than did male calyces. These results suggest that substantial sexual differences in defense against florivory may have evolved in association with the differentiation of flower sexes and that a strong preference for the weakly defended flower sex may have evolved in florivores as a counter-adaptation.},

Many defense response genes involved in these signaling pathways have been characterized, but little is known about the selective pressures they experience. A representative set of 27 defense response genes were resequenced in a worldwide set of 96 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions, and patterns of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were evaluated in relation to an empirical distribution of SNPs generated from either 876 fragments or 236 fragments with {\textbackslash}textgreater400 bp coding sequence (this latter set was selected for comparisons with coding sequences) distributed across the genomes of the same set of accessions. Defense response genes have significantly fewer protein variants, display lower levels of nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity, and have fewer nonsynonymous segregating sites. The majority of defense response genes appear to be experiencing purifying selection, given the dearth of protein variation in this set of genes. Eight genes exhibit some evidence of partial selective sweeps or transient balancing selection. These results therefore provide a strong contrast to the high levels of balancing selection exhibited by genes at the upstream positions in these signaling pathways.},

Climate warming is considered a major cause, although the relationship between temperature and the cicada population increase remains unclear. By examining cold tolerance in overwintering eggs of C. facialis in relation to another cicada, Graptopsaltria nigrofuscata, whose population has recently decreased in Osaka, we tested the hypothesis that warming has caused the population increase of C. facialis by decreasing egg mortality due to winter temperatures. A short-term (24 h) cold exposure experiment demonstrated that the half-lethal temperatures (LT50) of C. facialis and G. nigrofuscata were −23.3°C and −28.9°C, respectively, although these extreme low temperatures never occurred in Osaka during the 20th century. Prolonged exposure to −5°C for up to 30 days had no harmful effects on the hatching rate in either species. Overwintering mortality was also assessed under naturally fluctuating conditions by transferring eggs to cooler elevated sites that mimicked the environment prior to the current warming. Eggs of C. facialis that overwintered at the cooler site exhibited similar hatching rates to those maintained at the original site. The results of these experiments consistently indicated that overwintering eggs of C. facialis possess adequate tolerance to the low temperatures of the 20th century. Therefore, we rejected our initial hypothesis that recent increases in the C. facialis population have been caused by warming-related reductions in overwintering egg mortality.},

Interspecific and intraspecific binary feeding choices were offered to the snail Helix aspersa. The choices were between: (1) plants of the invasive Senecio inaequidens and Senecio pterophorus derived from populations in the introduced range (Europe) and plants of three indigenous species (Senecio jacobea, Senecio vulgaris and Senecio malacitanus) from populations in Europe; (2) plants of the invasive S. inaequidens and S. pterophorus from populations in the introduced range (Europe) and from populations in the native range (South Africa). We did not find a clear pattern of preference for indigenous or alien species of Senecio. However, we found that European invasive populations of S. inaequidens and S. pterophorus were less palatable than South African native populations. Moreover, in contrast to the predictions of the EICA hypothesis, the invasive genotypes of both species also showed a higher total concentration of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, and in the case of S. inaequidens we also found higher growth than in native genotypes. Our results are discussed with respect to the refinement of the EICA hypothesis that takes into account the difference between specialist and generalist herbivores and between qualitative and quantitative defences. We conclude that invasive populations of S. inaequidens and S. pterophorus are less palatable than native populations, suggesting that genetic differentiation associated with founding may occur and contribute to the plants’ invasion success by selecting the best-defended genotypes in the introduced range.},

	abstract = {As a result of their morphological complexity, large macroalgae show intra-thallus variations in their nutritional composition and secondary metabolite content, which influences the trophic ecology of herbivorous invertebrates, and ultimately their fitness. In this study, we evaluated for the first time the variability in nutritional quality (protein content, carbohydrates, lipids, and total organic matter), secondary metabolites (phlorotannins), and structure (shape and toughness) between blades and stipes of the macroalgae Durvillaea Antarctica. Specifically, we looked at their effect on feeding preference, rate of consumption, absorption efficiency, and growth rate of the amphipod Orchestoidea tuberculata, one of the most abundant organisms on Chilean sandy beaches. Proteins, carbohydrates, total organic matter and phlorotannin contents were significantly higher in blades than in stipes. Preference experiments revealed that the amphipods preferred blades when fresh pieces of blades and stipes were offered at the same time. Similar results were found when artificial food (in which structures of both parts of the alga were standardized) was offered, suggesting that shape and toughness of the two different parts of the alga did not influence preference patterns of O. tuberculata. Absorption efficiency of O. tuberculata was higher on blades compared to stipes. When the amphipods were kept with each of the algal parts separately (i.e. no choice), they consumed a significantly higher amount of stipe, which suggests that O. tuberculata used food quantity to compensate for the lower nutritional quality of stipes. The higher nutritional values of blades compared to stipes appears to explain observed preference patterns by O. tuberculata. Phlorotannin content did not appear to inhibit blade consumption, suggesting that the nutritional quality of the food could be more important than chemical defense in determining food choice in O. tuberculata. Growth did not differ between the amphipods maintained with either blades or stipes (i.e. no choice), which is consistent with the hypothesis of compensatory feeding. To conclude, O. tuberculata can actively select specific parts of an alga and this selection appears to be based on nutritional quality. The capacity for using different feeding strategies allow O. tuberculata, in some cases, to successfully exploit food types with different nutritional qualities.},

This conceptual framework has been developed mostly in systems of trophic interactions. Many coincidental changes, however, are involved in trophic interactions, preventing us from describing the direct impact of phenological shifts on fitness consequences. Here we address the phenological relationship in a simple non-trophic interaction to document a causal process of a warming-driven fitness change in a cicada, Cryptotympana facialis, whose numbers increased dramatically in Osaka, Japan in the late 20th century. We show that synchrony of the rainy season and hatching time may have a substantial influence on hatching success, by 1) shifting the time of completion of embryonic development, and 2) supplying water at various intervals. We estimate the change in hatching time over the last eleven decades (1901–2009) based on meteorological records and the temperature-dependent rate of C. facialis embryogenesis. Our estimate shows that hatching had initially occurred after the rainy season, and that warming had advanced it into the rainy season in the late 20th century. The probability of hatching success was markedly variable, and often very low before this synchronization occurred, but became stably high thereafter. Our findings suggest that the stabilizing effect of this synchrony on fitness was indispensable to the recent population increase of C. facialis.},

	abstract = {Population sizes of insect herbivores on natural plant hybrids may be higher, lower, or intermediate to those on the parent species. I studied the biology and population dynamics of a species of free-living aphid (Pterocallis alni) in a hybrid zone of alder (Alnus sp.). The parent trees were Alnus glutinosa and A. incana and their hybrid was A. pubescens. Hybrid trees differed from parents in phenological and morphological characters. Leaf trichome density on hybrid trees was intermediate to trichome densities on A. glutinosa (high density) and A. incana (low density), and thus appeared to be inherited in an additive manner. High trichome density on A. incana resulted in very high mortality and eventual elimination of aphids colonizing this tree. Aphid populations on the hybrid A. pubescens were higher than on A. incana, but lower than on A. glutinosa. However, aphid susceptibility did not appear to be inherited in a strictly additive fashion, as there was a dominance deviation in favor of the susceptible parent. This lack of additivity in insect resistance was most likely due to threshold effect if trichome density, with the density on the hybrid species below the level for the tree to be aphid resistant. Population differences on A. glutinosa and A. pubescens were not caused by differences in growth or reproduction of aphids between hosts. Cage-reared aphids on these two hosts had identical performance in five successive generations. The effect of caging probably reduced wind movement of trichomes and thereby reduced the probability of aphids being dislodged from their feeding site. Predator and parasitoid species responded in a similar manner to the aphids; their numbers were intermediate on the hybrid hosts.},

	abstract = {Abstract.— Motivated by data demonstrating fluctuating relative and absolute fitnesses for white- versus blue-flowered morphs of the desert annual Linanthus parryae, we present conditions under which temporally fluctuating selection and fluctuating contributions to a persistent seed bank will maintain a stable single-locus polymorphism. In L. parryae, blue flower color is determined by a single dominant allele. To disentangle the underlying diversity-maintaining mechanism from the mathematical complications associated with departures from Hardy-Weinberg genotype frequencies and dominance, we successively analyze a haploid model, a diploid model with three distinguishable genotypes, and a diploid model with complete dominance. For each model, we present conditions for the maintenance of a stable polymorphism, then use a diffusion approximation to describe the long-term fluctuations associated with these polymorphisms. Our protected polymorphism analyses show that a genotype whose arithmetic and geometric mean relative fitnesses are both less than one can persist if its relative fitness exceeds one in years that produce the most offspring. This condition is met by data from a population of L. parryae whose white morph has higher fitness (seed set) only in years of relatively heavy rain fall. The data suggest that the observed polymorphism may be explained by fluctuating selection. However, the yearly variation in flower color frequencies cannot be fully explained by our simple models, which ignore age structure and possible selection in the seed bank. We address two additional questions–one mathematical, the other biological–concerning the applicability of diffusion approximations to intense selection and the applicability of long-term predictions to datasets spanning decades for populations with long-lived seed banks.},

	abstract = {The enzyme myrosinase (EC 3.2.3.1.147) is present in specialised myrosin cells and forms part of the glucosinolate–myrosinase system, also known as ‘the mustard oil bomb’, which has an important role in the defence system of cruciferous plants against insect pests. Transgenic Brassica napus MINELESS have been produced by transgenic ablation of myrosin cells. This prompted us to investigate the importance of myrosin cells in plant–aphid interactions. In order to study this, we challenged transgenic MINELESS and wild-type cultivar Westar seedlings with the aphids Brevicoryne brassicae (a specialist) and Myzus persicae (a generalist). Our study included aphid free-choice and aphid fecundity experiments. Data from these experiments showed that B. brassicae prefers wild-type seedlings and M. persicae prefers MINELESS. B. brassicae and M. persicae showed significant variation in establishment on plants regardless of whether they were wild type or MINELESS and also differed significantly in affecting plant parts. Myrosinase activity in MINELESS control seedlings was 83.6\% lower than the wild-type control seedlings. Infestation with either of the two aphid species induced myrosinase levels in both wild-type and MINELESS seedlings. Infestation with M. persicae reduced the concentration of most glucosinolates while B. brassicae had the opposite effect. B. brassicae enhanced the formation of glucosinolate hydrolysis products both in wild-type and MINELESS seedlings. However, M. persicae decreased All ITC but increased 3,4ETBut NIT in wild-type seedlings. Taken together, the investigation shows that the presence of myrosin cells affects the preference of generalist and specialist aphid species for Brassica napus plants.},

Although much information about the genome of the species of Arabidopsis has been collected, knowing the genomic structure of targeted systems is required for determining which genes are involved in adaptation to particular environments. In this study using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP), we determined the genomic structure of A. halleri subsp. gemmifera (Brassicaceae) on Mt. Ibuki, Japan, where two ecotypes adapted to lowland and highland environments grow. Based on 273 loci (4.4\% of the loci were outliers), genotypes of 17 and 14 individuals of lowland and highland ecotypes, respectively, were determined. When excluding outliers, genetic differentiation between the two ecotypes was low (F\_{\textbackslash}textlessST{\textbackslash}textgreater=0.017). The genotypes of each ecotype, however, were distinguishable using principle coordinate analysis. The genome-wide investigation of the two ecotypes of A. halleri subsp. gemmifera on Mt. Ibuki therefore suggests that morphological divergence as well as adaptation to local environments between lowland and highland ecotypes occurred recently and the two ecotypes share a similar genomic structure. These two ecotypes are therefore appropriate for studies to reveal the genetic basis of morphological divergence as well as local adaptation using genomic information from A. thaliana.},

	abstract = {For the Levene model with soft selection in two demes, the maintenance of polymorphism at two diallelic loci is studied. Selection is nonepistatic and dominance is intermediate. Thus, there is directional selection in every deme and at every locus. We assume that selection is in opposite directions in the two demes because otherwise no polymorphism is possible. If at one locus there is no dominance, then a complete analysis of the dynamical and equilibrium properties is performed. In particular, a simple necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an internal equilibrium and sufficient conditions for global asymptotic stability are obtained. These results are extended to deme-independent degree of dominance at one locus. A perturbation analysis establishes structural stability within the full parameter space. In the absence of genotype-environment interaction, which requires deme-independent dominance at both loci, nongeneric equilibrium behavior occurs, and the introduction of arbitrarily small genotype-environment interaction changes the equilibrium structure and may destroy stable polymorphism. The volume of the parameter space for which a (stable) two-locus polymorphism is maintained is computed numerically. It is investigated how this volume depends on the strength of selection and on the dominance relations. If the favorable allele is (partially) dominant in its deme, more than 20\% of all parameter combinations lead to a globally asymptotically stable, fully polymorphic equilibrium.},

	abstract = {Plants are obliged to defend themselves against multiple generalist and specialist herbivores. Whereas plant cyanogenesis is considered an efficient defence against generalists, it is thought to affect specialists less. In the present study, we analysed the function of various cyanogenic features of lima bean [Phaseolus lunatus L. (Fabaceae)] during interaction with different herbivores. Three cyanogenic features were analysed, i.e., cyanogenic potential (HCNp; concentration of cyanogenic precursors), β-glucosidase activity, and cyanogenic capacity (HCNc; release of cyanide per unit time). In no-choice and free-choice feeding trials, five lima bean accessions were offered to generalist desert locust [Schistocerca gregaria Forskål (Orthoptera: Acrididae)] and specialist Mexican bean beetle [Epilachna varivestis Mulsant (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae)]. The HCNc was the most important parameter determining host plant selection by generalists, whereas choice behaviour of specialists was strongly affected by HCNp. Although locusts were effectively repelled by high HCNc, this cue was misleading for the detection of suitable host plants, as extensive consumption of low HCNc plant material resulted in strong intoxication of locusts. Balancing cyanide in consumed leaf area, the quantitative release of gaseous cyanide during feeding, and cyanide in faeces suggested that specialists metabolized significantly lower rates of cyanide per consumed leaf material than generalists. We hypothesize that specialists are able to avoid toxic concentrations of cyanide by using HCNp rather than HCNc as a cue for host plant quality, and that they exhibit mechanisms that reduce incorporation of host plant cyanide.},

However, there has been very little experimental evidence of the impact of the evolution of sexually selected traits on life-history traits. This study investigated whether increased investment in exaggerated traits can generate evolutionary changes in the life-history strategy for armed males. Male flour beetles, Gnatocerus cornutus, have enlarged mandibles that are used in male–male competition, but females lack this character exaggeration completely. We subjected these weapons to 11 generations of bidirectional selection and found a correlated response in pupal survival but not in larval survival or adult longevity in the male. That is, selecting for male mandibles negatively impacted survival during the production of mandibles. There is no correlated response in the life-history traits of the female.},

	abstract = {We used 37 years of North American Breeding Bird Surveys to test for effects of periodical cicada (Magicicada spp.) emergences on the abundance and spatial synchrony of 24 species of avian predators in hardwood forests of the eastern United States. Fifteen (63\%) of the bird species exhibited numerical changes in abundance apparently associated with emergences of the local periodical cicada brood, and intraspecific spatial synchrony of bird abundance was significantly greater between populations sharing the same cicada brood than between populations in the ranges of different broods. Species exhibited at least four partially overlapping temporal patterns. (I) Cuckoos (Coccyzus spp.) occurred in high numbers only during emergence years and subsequently declined in abundance. (2) Red-bellied Woodpeckers (Melanerpes carolinus), Blue Jays (Cyanocitta cristata), Common Grackles (Quiscalus quiscula), and Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) increased significantly 1-3 years following emergences and then declined. (3) Red-headed Woodpeckers (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), American Crows (Corvus brachyrynchos), Tufted Titmice (Baeolophus bicolor), Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis), and Brown Thrashers (Toxostoma rufum) were found in significantly low numbers during emergence years, underwent significant numerical increases in the following year, and then stabilized. (4) Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina), Northern Mockingbirds (Mimus polyglottos), Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), and House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) exhibited significantly deviant population numbers 1-2 years prior to emergences, below the long-term mean in the first two species and above the long-term mean in the latter two. These results suggest that the pulses of resources available at 13- or 17-year intervals when periodical cicadas emerge have significant demographic effects on key avian predators, mostly during or immediately after emergences, but in some cases apparently years following emergence events.},

	abstract = {We examined patterns of nucleotide diversity at a genomic region containing two linked candidate disease resistance (NBS-LRR) genes in seven populations of the outcrossing plant Arabidopsis lyrata. In comparison with two adjacent control genes and neutral reference genes across the genome, the NBS-LRR genes exhibited elevated nonsynonymous variation and a large number of major-effect polymorphisms causing early stop codons and/or frameshift mutations. In contrast, analysis of synonymous diversity provided no evidence that the region was subject to long-term balancing selection or recent selective sweeps in any of the seven populations surveyed. Also in contrast with earlier surveys of one of these R genes, there was no evidence that the resistance genes or the major-effect mutations were subject to elevated differentiation between populations. We suggest that conditional neutrality in the absence of the corresponding pathogen, rather than long-term balancing selection or local adaptation, may in some circumstances be a significant cause of elevated functional polymorphism at R genes. In contrast with the R genes, analysis of diversity and differentiation at the flanking FERONIA locus showed high population divergence, suggesting local adaptation on this locus controlling male–female signalling during fertilization.},

This species shows extreme variation in colour and pattern between populations that have been geographically isolated for {\textbackslash}textless 10,000 years. While previous research has suggested the involvement of divergent selection, to date no quantitative test has examined this hypothesis. Location Bocas del Toro archipelago, Panama. Methods We use a combination of population genetics, phylogeography and phenotypic analyses to test for divergent selection in coloration in O. pumilio. Tissue samples of 88 individuals from 15 distinct populations were collected. Using these data, we developed a gene tree using the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) d-loop region. Using parameters derived from our mtDNA phylogeny, we predicted the coalescence of a hypothetical nuclear gene underlying coloration. We collected spectral reflectance and body size measurements on 94 individuals from four of the populations and performed a quantitative analysis of phenotypic divergence. Results The mtDNA d-loop tree revealed considerable polyphyly across populations. Coalescent reconstructions of gene trees within population trees revealed incomplete genotypic sorting among populations. The quantitative analysis of phenotypic divergence revealed complete lineage sorting by colour, but not by body size: populations showed non-overlapping variation in spectral reflectance measures of body coloration, while variation in body size did not separate populations. Simulations of the coalescent using parameter values derived from our empirical analyses demonstrated that the level of sorting among populations seen in colour cannot reasonably be attributed to drift. Main conclusions These results imply that divergence in colour, but not body size, is occurring at a faster rate than expected under neutral processes. Our study provides the first quantitative support for the claim that strong diversifying selection underlies colour variation in the strawberry poison frog.},

	abstract = {It is generally assumed that specialist insect herbivores utilize plant odours to find their particular host plants and that visual cues are of minor importance in the host-finding process. We performed Y-tube olfactometer bioassays and small-scale field experiments to determine whether, under laboratory and field conditions, the monophagous herbivore Altica engstroemi J. Sahlberg (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Alticinae) is guided to its host plant Filipendula ulmaria (L.) Maxim. (Rosaceae) by visual or olfactory cues. The olfactometer tests showed that A. engstroemi was never attracted to odours, either from undamaged or from damaged plants. Even starvation for 24 h did not change this behaviour. However, the field experiment showed that visual cues alone were sufficient to attract a significant number of starved beetles when offered a choice between bagged host plants and bagged green plastic control ‘plants’. Our findings contrast with the general view that plant odours constitute the major cue in the host-finding process among specialized phytophagous insects. A review of the literature for the period 1986–2006 inclusive, relating to host-plant finding in Chrysomelidae, identified studies of 19 chrysomelid species, all of which were guided by olfactory cues. No species were guided to their host by visual cues. Although some studies demonstrated that chrysomelids may exhibit orientation responses to colour or contrast, our study on A. engstroemi is the only one demonstrating that visual cues affect host-plant selection in a chrysomelid species. We suggest that the use of visual cues in host-finding may evolve among chrysomelids with limited dispersal ability in persistent habitats and may be found among species monophagous on abundant host plants that dominate the structure of the plant community, that is, where the host plant's presence is predictable in time and space.},

Genetic diversity within populations was found to be high (average \$H\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{E\}{\textbackslash}textbackslash,\}=0.659\$ ), whereas population differentiation was low ( \$F\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{ST\}{\textbackslash}textbackslash,\}=0.023\$ ; \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathrm\{ST\}{\textbackslash}textbackslash,\}=0.025\$ ). However, we detected significant isolation by distance. A neighbor‐joining tree based on genetic distances among the populations reflected the geographic location of the populations and identified three distinct subdivisions, in the northeastern, central, and southwestern regions (the bootstrap values for internal branches between these regions are 87\% and 91\%). This finding was supported by boundaries detected by Monmonier’s maximum‐difference algorithm. In addition, Bayesian clustering analysis, using multilocus genotypes, revealed two distinct clusters that correlated with the geographical distributions of the populations, consistent with the results of the other analyses. The distribution of the two clusters suggests that, as a result of historical migrations, genetic mixing has occurred between two ancestral populations with different genetic backgrounds.},

I review traditional approaches used to demonstrate or suggest adaptation to irradiance level, and outline three energetic tradeoffs likely to shape such adaptation, involving the economics of gas exchange, support, and biotic interactions.

	abstract = {While the presence/absence polymorphism is commonly observed in disease resistance (R-) genes in Arabidopsis, only a few R-genes under the presence/absence polymorphism (R-P/A) have been investigated. To understand the mechanism of the molecular evolution of R-P/A, we investigated genetic variation of nine R-P/A in A. thaliana from worldwide populations. The number of possessed R-genes varied widely among accessions (two to nine, on average 4.3 ± 1.6/accession). No pair of accessions shared the same haplotype, and no clear geographic differentiation was observed with respect to the pattern of presence/absence of the R-genes investigated. Presence allele frequencies also varied among loci (25–70\%), and no linkage disequilibrium was detected among them. Although the LRR region in regular R-genes is known to be highly polymorphic and has a high Ka/Ks ratio in A. thaliana, nucleotide sequences of this region in the R-P/A showed a relatively low level of genetic variation (π = 0.0002–0.016) and low Ka/Ks (0.03–0.70, {\textbackslash}textless1). In contrast, the nucleotide diversities around the deletion junction of R-P/A were constantly high between presence and absence accessions for the R-genes (Dxy = 0.031–0.103). Our results suggest that R-P/A loci evolved differently from other R-gene loci and that balancing selection plays an important role in molecular evolution of R-P/A.},

	abstract = {The composition of communities of sessile organisms, and the change in species diversity with time, is a spatially explicit phenomenon. Three spatial factors clearly affect diversity: (1) the structure and heterogeneity of the landscape that limits species immigration and ultimate community size; (2) neighborhood interactions that determine colonization and extinction rates and influence residence times of local populations; and (3) disturbances that open spatially contiguous areas for recolonization by less abundant species. The importance of these three factors was first reviewed and then examined with a spatially explicit, multi-species model of plant dispersal, competition and establishment, with an assumption of neutrality (all species had equivalent life histories) that reduced the initial dimensionality of the problem. The simulations assumed that the probability of immigration was a linear function of mainland abundance and distance to islands, similar to the equilibrium theory of island biogeography and the unified neutral theory of biodiversity. The rate of increase in species richness was not constant across island sizes, declining as island area became very large. This pattern was explained by the spatial dynamics of colonization and establishment, a non-random process that cannot be explained by passive sampling alone. Simulations showed that population establishment depended critically on rare long-distance dispersal events while population persistence was achieved by the formation of aggregated species distributions that developed through restricted dispersal and local competitive interactions. Nevertheless, species richness always declined to a single species in the absence of disturbances, while up to 40 species could persist to 10,000 years when spatially dependent mortality was added. Further explorations with spatially explicit models will be required to fully appreciate the consequence of land use change and altered disturbance regimes on patterns of species distribution and the maintenance of diversity.},

M. cruciger can complete full development on species within closely-related genera in the Boraginaceae, but prefers houndstongue as a host. Of the 22 species of native North American Boraginaceae that were tested in this study, nine species from four genera within the tribe Eritrichieae ( Cryptantha, Hackelia, Mertensia and Lappula ) clearly supported development of M. cruciger . However, generally these non-target species experienced less attack by M. cruciger relative to houndstongue. There were differences in the incidence and degree of attack depending on the test type, which included the use of potted test plants in laboratory no-choice and open-field choice situations. The least non-target attack occurred on rangeland in British Columbia, Canada, where potted test plants were introduced into sites where the insect had been previously released on houndstongue. These results suggest that M. cruciger has a narrow ecological host range. Special emphasis was placed on testing species of Cryptantha because C. crassipes is listed as endangered in the USA. Six of 12 Cryptantha species tested supported full development, but generally, the incidence and intensity of attack were less for these species relative to houndstongue. There was no, or incomplete development, on tested species of Plagiobothrys , a genus that contains two species listed as endangered in the USA.},

The means of total and silent nucleotide variation (θW) are within the range expected for the species. The population genetic neutrality tests Tajima’s D and Wall’s B had significant composite results rejecting panmixia, and Approximate Bayesian Computation analysis revealed that a subdivision model better explained the variation than the standard neutral model, refugia (or admixture), bottleneck or change of population size models. A categorical regression analysis further supports the subdivision model, and under the subdivision model, the neutrality tests are no longer significant. The best support was for two source populations, a situation consistent with the mixing of two populations possibly mediated by human activity. This scenario might limit the genetic diversity and adaptive potential of the population. The non-neutral population variation described here should be considered in bioinformatic searches for adaptation.},

	abstract = {The ability to cope with water limitation influences plant distributions, and several plant traits have been interpreted as adaptations to drought stress. In Scandinavia, the perennial herb Arabidopsis lyrata occurs in open habitats that differ widely in climate and water availability in summer, suggesting differential selection on drought-related traits. We conducted two greenhouse experiments to examine differentiation in drought response traits among six Scandinavian populations, and to determine whether leaf trichomes confer protection against drought. We quantified tolerance to drought as fitness (survival and biomass of survivors) when exposed to drought relative to fitness under non-drought conditions. Two Swedish populations from shores along the Bothnian Bay had higher tolerance to drought than four riverbed populations from Norway. Under conditions of drought, the shore populations experienced less leaf damage compared to the riverbed populations, and their survival and biomass were less reduced relative to non-drought conditions. Across populations, tolerance to drought was positively related to leaf mass per area and negatively related to flowering propensity and proportion roots, but not related to plant size at the initiation of the drought treatment. In populations polymorphic for trichome production, trichome-producing plants were more tolerant to drought than glabrous plants. The results suggest that both leaf morphology and life-history traits contribute to differential drought response in natural populations of A. lyrata, and that this system offers excellent opportunities for examining the adaptive value and genetic basis of drought-related traits.},

Fitness-associated loci exhibited both geographic and climatic signatures of local adaptation. Relative to genomic controls, high-fitness alleles were generally distributed closer to the site where they increased fitness, occupying specific and distinct climate spaces. Independent loci with different molecular functions contributed most strongly to fitness variation in each site.

	abstract = {Herbivorous insects identify their host plants either by structural features, chemical cues, or a combination. Some insects probe the host leaf prior feeding or oviposition, other species use olfactorial cues or compounds somewhere on the surface. Insects attacking Brassicaceae are no exception, some are attracted and stimulated by volatile isothiocyanates (ITC), many others depend fully on the non-volatile glucosinolates (GS) for host-plant recognition and acceptance. Since most insects have no access to the leaf interior investigators concluded that GS must be present on the leaf surface and ITC in the headspace. However, peelings of mechanically removed surface waxes were devoid of measurable amounts of GS, whereas solvent surface extractions revealed a correlation between stomatal conditions and GS concentrations. Both observations lead to the conclusion that the presence of GS on the top leaf surface is rather unlikely. In the experimental part we show that a chloroform/methanol/water (2:1:1 vol/vol/vol) solvent leaf extract contains GS and, in addition, thia-triaza-fluorenes (TTF), other oviposition stimulants of the cabbage root fly, Delia radicum. Electrophysiological investigations showed that both, GS and TTF stimulated specific receptor neurones of the fly. We suggest that these compounds probably originated from deeper leaf layers and that herbivorous insects may penetrate the wax layer and perceive the stimulating compounds in deeper layers or through the stomata.},

The difference in hybrid production is best explained by corolla color. The self- and cross-compatibility of nine sympatric and nine allopatric populations were studied in the greenhouse. On the average, sympatric populations are more self-compatible than allopatric populations. Pollen germination is 13.7\% vs. 7.3\%, the difference being statistically significant.

The germination of P. cuspidata pollen on sympatric P. drummondii stigmas was 13.3\% vs. 9.8\% on allopatric stigmas. However, the difference is not statistically significant. The presence of P. cuspidata has promoted reproductive character divergence in P. drummondii.

The perennial, self-incompatible herb Arabidopsis lyrata is polymorphic for trichome production, and occurs in a glabrous and a trichomeproducing form. Controlled crosses indicate that the polymorphism is governed by a single gene, with trichome production being dominant. We examined the hypothesis that trichome production is subject to divergent selection (i.e., directional selection favoring different phenotypes in different populations) by comparing patterns of variation at the locus coding for glabrousness and at eight putatively neutral isozyme loci in Swedish populations of A. lyrata. The genetic diversity (He) and allele number at isozyme loci tended to increase with population size and decreased with latitude of origin, whereas genetic diversity at the locus coding for glabrousness did not vary with population size and increased with latitude of origin. The degree of genetic differentiation at the glabrousness locus was much higher than that at isozyme loci. Genetic identity at isozyme loci was negatively related to geographic distance, suggesting isolation by distance. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between genetic identity at the glabrousness locus and at isozyme loci. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that divergent selection contributes to population differentiation in trichome production in A. lyrata.},

We tested how rapid evolution impacts concurrent population dynamics using an aphid (Myzus persicae) and an undomesticated host (Hirschfeldia incana) in replicated wild populations. We manipulated evolvability by creating non-evolving (single clone) and potentially evolving (two-clone) aphid populations that contained genetic variation in intrinsic growth rate. We observed significant evolution in two-clone populations whether or not they were exposed to predators and competitors. Evolving populations grew up to 42\% faster and attained up to 67\% higher density, compared with non-evolving control populations but only in treatments exposed to competitors and predators. Increased density also correlates with relative fitness of competing clones suggesting a full eco-evolutionary dynamic cycle defined as reciprocal interactions between evolution and density.},

When herbivores encounter a novel host, local selection pressures are expected to shape traits that mediate plant–insect interactions. I show that a leafmining fly, Amauromyza flavifrons (Meigen) (Diptera: Agromyzidae), suffers a profound fitness cost by ovipositing on a novel host, Beta vulgaris L. (sugar beet) (Chenopodiaceae). Leafminers from a sugar beet-free population readily oviposit on B. vulgaris leaves, whereas those collected from a population near sugar beet farms discriminate against B. vulgaris. This finding suggests that oviposition specificity in A. flavifrons populations may have evolved in response to the presence of the novel host, and represents the first evidence of host-avoidance evolution in the wild. Because this study compared only one pair of populations and thus lacks replication, future studies will test whether parallel evolution has occurred at B. vulgaris farm locales across North America.},

Only a handful of studies have quantified heritable variation for nectar traits, primarily in controlled environments that minimize environmental variation. Most such studies have reported strong genetic influences, with heritabilities often {\textbackslash}textgreater0.35. However, because nectar traits are often very responsive to environmental variation, even substantial amounts of genetic variation may be swamped out in the field. Environmental variation deserves to be studied in its own right, including exploration of genotype x environment interaction for nectar traits. Most genetic studies of nectar have focused on production rate and concentration, whereas we know almost nothing about the heritability of other important traits such as production patterns, sugar ratios, amino acid composition, taste, and scent. Likewise, almost nothing is known about the heritability of extrafloral nectar traits. Important progress on all of these fronts can be made using simple experimental designs to quantify environmental effects, genotype x environment interactions, clonal repeatability, and correlated traits. There is great promise in molecular approaches, but their use will not obviate the need for more quantitative genetic studies in the field and greenhouse.},

Differences were noted in the number of trichomes per 300-mm2 leaf area, plant heights, and canopy closure indices for the 14 soybean entries, but these differences showed no correlation to 1993 and 1994 infestation levels of Bemisia argentifolii Bellows \& Perring and Trialeurodes abutilonea (Haldeman). However, differences in trichome erectness ratings corresponded to differences in whitefly populations during both seasons, particularly in 1994 when overall population densities were higher. `N88-9l', `Cook', and `Perrin' had lower seasonal mean densities of whiteflies in 1993 and 1994 than several of the other entries. These entries also had higher erectness ratings (trichomes flat on leaf surface) than the entries with higher whitefly populations. `N89-1' had lower erectness ratings (trichomes erect) and higher whitefly populations than most other entries in both 1993 and 1994. Analysis of the epicuticular lipid composition of 10 soybean genotypes detected differences among the entries of levels for n-hentriacontane, a-amyrin, 13- amyrin, and lupeol (triterpenol). These differences were not correlated to whitefly population densities for any of the chemical constituents. However, entries with low levels of lupeol (below 5 μg/cm2)tended to have higher whitefly populations. B. argentifolii was the predominant whitefly species observed at this test site. Over 85\% of the immatures observed on the leaf surface and over 90\% of the adult whiteflies captured on yellow sticky cards were B. argentifolii, whereas low numbers of T. abutilonea were observed.},

These alternative sources of beneficial alleles can result in different evolutionary dynamics and distinct genetic outcomes. Compared with new mutations, adaptation from standing genetic variation is likely to lead to faster evolution, the fixation of more alleles of small effect and the spread of more recessive alleles. There is potential to distinguish between adaptation from standing variation and that from new mutations by differences in the genomic signature of selection. Here we review these approaches and possible examples of adaptation from standing variation in natural populations. Understanding how the source of genetic variation affects adaptation will be integral for predicting how populations will respond to changing environments.},

However, plant strategies may also represent density- or frequency-dependent adaptations to the strategies used by neighbours. Game theory provides the tools to characterise such density- and frequency-dependent interactions. Here, we review the contributions of game theory to plant ecology. After briefly reviewing game theory from the perspective of plant ecology, we divide our review into three sections. First, game theoretical models of allocation to shoots and roots often predict investment in those organs beyond what would be optimal in the absence of competition. Second, game theoretical models of enemy defence suggest that an individual's investment in defence is not only a means of reducing its own tissue damage but also a means of deflecting enemies onto competitors. Finally, game theoretical models of trade with mutualistic partners suggest that the optimal trade may reflect competition for access to mutualistic partners among plants. In short, our review provides an accessible entrance to game theory that will help plant ecologists enrich their research with its worldview and existing predictions.},

	abstract = {Modern herbicides make major contributions to global food production by easily removing weeds and substituting for destructive soil cultivation. However, persistent herbicide selection of huge weed numbers across vast areas can result in the rapid evolution of herbicide resistance. Herbicides target specific enzymes, and mutations are selected that confer resistance-endowing amino acid substitutions, decreasing herbicide binding. Where herbicides bind within an enzyme catalytic site very few mutations give resistance while conserving enzyme functionality. Where herbicides bind away from a catalytic site many resistance-endowing mutations may evolve. Increasingly, resistance evolves due to mechanisms limiting herbicide reaching target sites. Especially threatening are herbicide-degrading cytochrome P450 enzymes able to detoxify existing, new, and even herbicides yet to be discovered. Global weed species are accumulating resistance mechanisms, displaying multiple resistance across many herbicides and posing a great challenge to herbicide sustainability in world agriculture. Fascinating genetic issues associated with resistance evolution remain to be investigated, especially the possibility of herbicide stress unleashing epigenetic gene expression. Understanding resistance and building sustainable solutions to herbicide resistance evolution are necessary and worthy challenges.},

In other words, I will answer the question of whether crypsis is a concept that can usefully be applied to non-visual sensory perception. Probably because vision is such an important sensory system in humans, research in this field is sparse. Thus, at present we have very few examples of chemical camouflage, and even these contain some ambiguity in deciding whether they are best seen as examples of background matching or mimicry. There are many examples of organisms that are adaptively silent at times or in locations when or where predation risk is higher or in response to detection of a predator. By contrast, evidence that the form (rather than use) of vocalizations and other sound-based signals has been influenced by issues of reducing detectability to unintended receivers is suggestive rather than conclusive. There is again suggestive but not completely conclusive evidence for crypsis against electro-sensing predators. Lastly, mechanoreception is highly understudied in this regard, but there are scattered reports that strongly suggest that some species can be thought of as being adapted to be cryptic in this modality. Hence, I conclude that crypsis is a concept that can usefully be applied to senses other than vision, and that this is a field very much worthy of more investigation.},

	abstract = {The microbial cosmopolitan dispersion hypothesis often invoked to explain distribution patterns driven by high connectivity of oceanographic water masses and widespread dispersal ability has never been rigorously tested. By using a global marine bacterial dataset and iterative matrix randomization simulation, we show that marine bacteria exhibit a significantly greater dispersal limitation than predicted by our null model using the “everything is everywhere” tenet with no dispersal limitation scenario. Specifically, marine bacteria displayed bipolar distributions (i.e., species occurring exclusively at both poles and nowhere else) significantly less often than in the null model. Furthermore, we observed fewer taxa present in both hemispheres but more taxa present only in a single hemisphere than expected under the null model. Each of these trends diverged further from the null expectation as the compared habitats became more geographically distant but more environmentally similar. Our meta-analysis supported a latitudinal gradient in bacterial diversity with higher richness at lower latitudes, but decreased richness toward the poles. Bacteria in the tropics also demonstrated narrower latitudinal ranges at lower latitudes and relatively larger ranges in higher latitudes, conforming to the controversial macroecological pattern of the “Rapoport rule.” Collectively, our findings suggest that bacteria follow biogeographic patterns more typical of macroscopic organisms, and that dispersal limitation, not just environmental selection, likely plays an important role. Distributions of microbes that deliver critical ecosystem services, particularly those in polar regions, may be vulnerable to the same impacts that environmental stressors, climate warming, and degradation in habitat quality are having on biodiversity in animal and plant species.},

Approximately one-third of the Arabidopsis genome is differentially expressed during the first 48 h after infection, with the majority of changes in gene expression occurring before significant lesion development. We used computational tools to obtain a detailed chronology of the defense response against B. cinerea, highlighting the times at which signaling and metabolic processes change, and identify transcription factor families operating at different times after infection. Motif enrichment and network inference predicted regulatory interactions, and testing of one such prediction identified a role for TGA3 in defense against necrotrophic pathogens. These data provide an unprecedented level of detail about transcriptional changes during a defense response and are suited to systems biology analyses to generate predictive models of the gene regulatory networks mediating the Arabidopsis response to B. cinerea.},

Unfortunately, most of these experiments have been done using either substitution or additive experimental designs. Substitution designs, and to a lesser extent additive designs, severely limit the useful inferences that ecologists can draw from the resulting data. Response surface experimental designs, which vary the densities of two competing species independently, offer the advantage of being able to compare the fits of alternative competition models and to estimate model parameters. This kind of experimental design has been relatively little used in ecology to date. I consider the use of response surface designs from two perspectives. The first is the optimal allocation of experimental effort among density treatments, with the goal of distinguishing among alternative models. Second, I compare the ability of six response surface designs to estimate known competition coefficients correctly, using simulated data. Low densities and densities near equilibrium in one generation tend to return similar densities the following generation and thus provide little or no information for comparing alternative population models. Experimental designs that span a wide range of densities, including high densities above carrying capacities, provide more accurate parameter estimates in general, but low densities are helpful for estimating population growth rates. Designs that are not fully factorial are one compromise solution that can yield accurate parameter estimates for models and yet require less experimental effort than full factorial surfaces. In general, response surfaces are a powerful class of experimental design and offer potentially stronger connections between empirical and theoretical approaches than traditional experimental designs.},

	abstract = {A major goal of population genetics research is to identify the relative influences of historical and contemporary processes that serve to structure genetic variation. Most population genetic models assume that populations exist in a state of migration-drift equilibrium. However, in the past this assumption has rarely been verified, and is likely rarely achieved in natural populations. We assessed the equilibrium status at both local and regional scales of the Atlantic killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus. This species is a model organism for the study of adaptive clinal variation, but has also experienced a complicated history of range expansion and secondary contact following allopatric divergence, potentially obscuring the influence of contemporary evolutionary processes. Presumptively neutral genetic markers (microsatellites) demonstrated zones of secondary intergradation among coastal populations centred around northern New Jersey and the Chesapeake Bay region. Analysis of genetic variation indicated isolation by distance among some populations and provided supporting evidence that the Delaware Bay, but not the Chesapeake Bay, has acted as a barrier to dispersal among coastal populations. Bayesian estimates indicated large effective population sizes and low migration rates, and were in good agreement with empirically derived estimates of population and neighbourhood size from mark–recapture studies. These data indicate that populations are not in migration-drift equilibrium at a regional scale, and suggest that contributing factors include large population size combined with relatively low migration rates. These conditions should be considered when interpreting the evolutionary significance of the distribution of genetic variation among F. heteroclitus populations.},

However, such genetic structure only reflects the history of a single gene, and studies based on single-copy genes of nuclear DNA (nDNA) are required for phylogeography, although their efficiency remains unclear. To examine the utility of nDNA loci, the genetic structures of three genes from Cardamine nipponica, which is closely related to the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, were elucidated: the nDNA genes DET1, PHYA, PHYE, as well as chloroplast DNA (cpDNA). In 279 individuals collected from throughout the range of the species, strong genetic differentiation between northern and central Japan was found for all loci. This result suggested that populations in central Japan experienced a different history from those in northern Japan during the Pleistocene climatic oscillations. In addition, the evidence of refugia at the edges of the distribution, where the genetic structure was less influenced by colonization following range expansion, was shown for several loci. The specific genetic structure within the southernmost populations of northern Japan suggested that this region was also isolated during range expansion. Hence, the consistent history among loci and a more detailed history from several loci indicated that cpDNA can represent the history of vicariance and demonstrated the efficiency of single-copy nuclear genes in phylogeography.},

The i5k initiative has begun sequencing of more than 5,000 insect genomes, which should greatly help in exploring insect resource and pest control. Insect genome annotation remains challenging because many insects have high levels of heterozygosity. To improve the quality of insect genome annotation, we developed a pipeline, named Optimized Maker-Based Insect Genome Annotation (OMIGA), to predict protein-coding genes from insect genomes. We first mapped RNA-Seq reads to genomic scaffolds to determine transcribed regions using Bowtie, and the putative transcripts were assembled using Cufflink. We then selected highly reliable transcripts with intact coding sequences to train de novo gene prediction software, including Augustus. The re-trained software was used to predict genes from insect genomes. Exonerate was used to refine gene structure and to determine near exact exon/intron boundary in the genome. Finally, we used the software Maker to integrate data from RNA-Seq, de novo gene prediction, and protein alignment to produce an official gene set. The OMIGA pipeline was used to annotate the draft genome of an important insect pest, Chilo suppressalis, yielding 12,548 genes. Different strategies were compared, which demonstrated that OMIGA had the best performance. In summary, we present a comprehensive pipeline for identifying genes in insect genomes that can be widely used to improve the annotation quality in insects.

	abstract = {Species with similar floral structures and with similar flowering periods and time of pollen and nectar presentation may compete for the service of the same pollinators. The outcome of interspecific competition was analyzed with a simple two-species model. The reproductive success of a species depends on its relative frequency. The minority species will be at a reproductive handicap because it suffers a larger percentage of heterospecific pollinations. The reproductive handicap of the minority species leads to a smaller standing crop in the next generation, which in turn enhances the minority disadvantage. This should lead to rapid exclusion of the minority species from the immediate flora. An increase in pollinator constancy to a given plant species retards the elimination of the rarer species. Pollinator preference for a given plant species may enhance or retard this progression depending on whether the minority species is preferred, since preference alters the effective frequencies of the two species. The minority disadvantage is reduced if the competing species have different habitat requirements or if they form large patches of regular size.},

Hormonal regulation of this plant induction response has not been previously studied. In a series of experiments, we addressed the effects of artificial damage, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and gibberellin on induction of trichomes in Arabidopsis. Artificial damage and jasmonic acid caused significant increases in trichome production of leaves. The jar1-1 mutant exhibited normal trichome induction following treatment with jasmonic acid, suggesting that adenylation of jasmonic acid is not necessary. Salicylic acid had a negative effect on trichome production and consistently reduced the effect of jasmonic acid, suggesting negative cross-talk between the jasmonate and salicylate-dependent defense pathways. Interestingly, the effect of salicylic acid persisted in the nim1-1 mutant, suggesting that the Npr1/Nim1 gene is not downstream of salicylic acid in the negative regulation of trichome production. Last, we found that gibberellin and jasmonic acid had a synergistic effect on the induction of trichomes, suggesting important interactions between these two compounds.},

	abstract = {Many empirical studies have assessed fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS), i.e. the nonrandom spatial distribution of genotypes, within plant populations using genetic markers and spatial autocorrelation techniques. These studies mostly provided qualitative descriptions of SGS, rendering quantitative comparisons among studies difficult. The theory of isolation by distance can predict the pattern of SGS under limited gene dispersal, suggesting new approaches, based on the relationship between pairwise relatedness coefficients and the spatial distance between individuals, to quantify SGS and infer gene dispersal parameters. Here we review the theory underlying such methods and discuss issues about their application to plant populations, such as the choice of the relatedness statistics, the sampling scheme to adopt, the procedure to test SGS, and the interpretation of spatial autocorrelograms. We propose to quantify SGS by an ‘Sp’ statistic primarily dependent upon the rate of decrease of pairwise kinship coefficients between individuals with the logarithm of the distance in two dimensions. Under certain conditions, this statistic estimates the reciprocal of the neighbourhood size. Reanalysing data from, mostly, published studies, the Sp statistic was assessed for 47 plant species. It was found to be significantly related to the mating system (higher in selfing species) and to the life form (higher in herbs than trees), as well as to the population density (higher under low density). We discuss the necessity for comparing SGS with direct estimates of gene dispersal distances, and show how the approach presented can be extended to assess (i) the level of biparental inbreeding, and (ii) the kurtosis of the gene dispersal distribution.},

In oviposition choice and no-choice tests, petroleum oil sprays suppressed oviposition inHelicoverpa punctigera (Wallengren) but notH. armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae).H. punctigera females laid about seven times as many eggs on the control (water sprayed) cotton plants as on either petroleum oil spray alone or oil mixed with Kelgum. HoweverH. armigera females laid the same number of eggs on both treated and control plants. In field trials, the number of eggs per metre per sample date found on the plots treated with petroleum oil spray was 3.83 compared with 6.29 and 7.82 eggs respectively on plots treated with conventional insecticide sprays and the unsprayed plots. The number of larvae found on plots treated with petroleum oil sprays was 2.9 times higher than the conventional insecticide sprayed plot, however, this was 1.6 times fewer than the unsprayed plot. The cotton yields from plots treated with petroleum oil sprays was 3.70 bales/ha compared with 7.32 and 2.69 bales respectively from the conventional insecticide treated and the unsprayed plots. Petroleum oil sprays had little or no effect on predatory beetles, bugs, lacewings and spiders.

Following successful biological control of the weed in Australia, two agents, the chrysomelid beetles Chrysolina hyperici and C. quadrigemina, were introduced to NZ in 1943 and 1965, respectively. At the time, the Australian host specificity testing, which had not included other Hypericum spp., was deemed sufficient for approval for release in NZ. We reviewed worldwide reports which suggest that St. John’s wort beetles will attack a range of Hypericum species in the field. A series of laboratory tests were conducted to simulate modern host-range-testing protocols. Larval feeding choice, larval development and female oviposition choice all suggested that at least two of NZ’s indigenous Hypericum species were suitable hosts for the two Chrysolina species, and a third indigenous Hypericum, while an unsuitable host, was not altogether avoided. We conclude that the two Chrysolina species would not have been approved for introduction to NZ under current risk assessment protocols. Had this happened, NZ would have missed out on one of its greatest biocontrol success stories, despite there being no evidence for subsequent impacts on the populations of indigenous congeners. This case stresses the need for better procedures to predict the realized host-range of an agent from the potential range in contained host-range testing, and raises issues surrounding risks and benefits to indigenous biodiversity.},

Whereas there is evidence that some pathogens suppress these defences by interfering with signalling pathways involved in the defence, such evidence is scarce for herbivores. We found that the invasive spider mite Tetranychus evansi suppresses the induction of the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signalling routes involved in induced plant defences in tomato. This was reflected in the levels of inducible defence compounds, such as proteinase inhibitors, which in mite-infested plants were reduced to even lower levels than the constitutive levels in herbivore-free plants. Additionally, the spider mite suppressed the release of inducible volatiles, which are implicated in plant defence. Consequently, the mites performed much better on previously attacked plants than on non-attacked plants. These findings provide a new perspective on plant–herbivore interactions, plant protection and plant resistance to invasive species.},

On the one hand, studies with insect herbivores have suggested that variation in the concentrations of foliar monoterpenes is related to variation in susceptibility. On the other, studies with marsupial folivores have suggested that variation in the concentrations of sideroxylonals (a group of formylated phloroglucinol compounds) is responsible for variation in susceptibility. We examined relative importance of sideroxylonals and 1,8-cineole (a dominant monoterpene) in host tree selection by Christmas beetles (Anoplognathus species: Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) by using no-choice experiments, choice/no-choice experiments, and manipulative experiments in which concentrations of sideroxylonals or 1,8-cineole were altered. We used two species of host Eucalyptus, one species of non-host Eucalyptus, and three species of non-host non-Eucalyptus trees. Leaf consumption by Christmas beetles was negatively correlated with the concentrations of sideroxylonals and 1,8-cineole. Artificial increases in the concentration of sideroxylonals or 1,8-cineole reduced leaf consumption by Christmas beetles. An artificial reduction in foliar monoterpenes had no effect on leaf consumption by the beetles when leaves contained high or very low concentrations of sideroxylonals. However, when the concentration of sideroxylonals was moderate, a reduction in the foliar monoterpenes increased leaf consumption by the beetles. Therefore, monoterpenes such as 1,8-cineole may be used as a negative cue by Christmas beetles. The pattern of food consumption on non-host Eucalyptus species and non-host non-Eucalyptus species suggest that both positive and negative cues may be used by Christmas beetles to select host trees.},

Although fern spores are physically analogous to orchid seeds, the intensity of FSGS exhibited in C. falcatum is four times stronger than that in 16 terrestrial orchid species.},

	abstract = {Three tallgrass prairie plant species, two common perennial forbs (Artemisia ludoviciana and Aster ericoides [Asteraceae]) and a dominant C4 perennial grass (Sorghastrum nutans) were studied under field and greenhouse conditions to evaluate interspecific variation in grazing tolerance (compensatory growth capacity). Adaptation to ungulate grazing was also assessed by comparing defoliation responses of plants from populations with a 25-yr history of no grazing or moderate ungulate grazing. Under field conditions, all three species showed significant reductions in shoot relative growth rates (RGR), biomass, and reproduction with defoliation. In the two forbs, clipping resulted in negative shoot RGR and reductions in both number and length of shoot branches per ramet. Sorghastrum nutans maintained positive RGR under defoliation due to a compensatory increase in leaf production. Defoliation reduced rhizome production in A. ericoides and S. nutans, but not in A. ludoviciana. Clipping significantly reduced sexual reproductive allocation in all three species, although S. nutans showed a smaller reduction than the forbs. All three species showed similar responses to defoliation in burned and unburned sites. Under greenhouse conditions, a similar clipping regimen resulted in smaller reductions in growth and reproduction than those observed in the field. For all three species, the grazing tolerance indices calculated under natural field conditions were significantly lower than those estimated from greenhouse-grown plants, and the interspecific patterns of grazing tolerance were different. Aster ericoides exhibited the highest overall defoliation tolerance under greenhouse conditions, followed by S. nutans. Artemisia ludoviciana, the only study species that is typically not grazed by ungulates in the field, showed the lowest grazing tolerance. In the field experiment S. nutans showed the highest grazing tolerance and the two forbs had similar low tolerance indices. These patterns indicate that, despite high compensatory growth potential, limited resource availability and competition in the field significantly reduce the degree of compensation and alter interspecific differences in grazing tolerance among prairie plants. In all three species, defoliation suppressed sexual reproduction more than growth or vegetative reproduction. Significant interactions between plant responses to defoliation and site of origin (historically grazed or ungrazed sites) for some response variables (root/shoot ratios, rhizome bud initiation, and reproductive allocation) indicated some degree of population differentiation and genetic adaptation in response to a relatively short history of ungulate grazing pressure. The results of this study indicate that patterns of grazing tolerance in tallgrass prairie are both genetically based and also environmentally dependent.},

When eggs were maintained at 25 °C from oviposition, both the species entered embryonic diapause within 60 days irrespective of photoperiod, but at different developmental stages between the two species. The optimal temperature for diapause development was approximately 15 °C in both the species. The development rate for postdiapause morphogenesis increased linearly with temperature in the range of 20–27.5 °C in C. facialis, and of 15–25 °C in G. nigrofuscata. The lower development threshold and the sum of effective temperatures were computed as 14.3 °C and 715.3 day-degrees in C. facialis and 12.1 °C and 566.6 day-degrees in G. nigrofuscata, respectively. The hatching dates predicted by these large thermal constants accorded with the hatching dates observed in the field, i.e., late June and mid-July in G. nigrofuscata and C. facialis, respectively.

We have estimated current levels of genetic diversity and population structure for black walnut (Juglans nigra L.), a highly valuable timber species, in the central hardwood region of the United States. Black walnut trees from 43 populations across this region were genotyped at 12 highly polymorphic microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity was high and populations only slightly deviated from Hardy-Weinberg proportions (FIS = 0.017). Considering the scale of our sampling, the species was remarkably genetically homogenous: FST was quite low (0.017), and in a Bayesian analysis the optimal higher-order partition was into a single group comprised of all 43 populations. Although black walnut is predominantly a bottomland species, very little genetic variance was partitioned among broad-scale hydrologic regions (FPT = 0.002). However, a weak, but statistically significant pattern of isolation by distance was detected. The results are consistent with a scenario in which black walnut recolonized its current range from a single glacial refugium, and where subsequent genetic effects associated with deforestation and habitat fragmentation have been mitigated by high levels of pollen flow. Nuclear microsatellites alone may be insufficient to identify hotspots for black walnut conservation.},

Four models were tested; these assumed either linear density-dependent, linear frequency-dependent, exponential density-dependent, or exponential frequency-dependent disease transmission.

Results from the experimental populations were consistent with model predictions that resistant populations would lose the disease, while susceptible hosts and pathogens would coexist. 4 Comparison of the actual changes in the numbers of diseased individuals with model predictions, showed that exponential disease transmission models provided a better overall fit to the data than linear models.},

Both nutrients and toxins influence foraging behavior, but their interactive effects remain poorly understood. Our aim was to determine how patterns of intake and feeding behavior are influenced by the nutritional composition of foods as modified by the presence of toxins and the capacity to choose between nutritionally different foods. We offered common brushtail possums, a generalist mammalian herbivore, a choice between 2 food mixtures, one high in protein (HP), the other high in carbohydrate (HC), or a no-choice diet formulated to reflect the mixture of protein and carbohydrate selected when animals had access to both HP and HC foods. We tested choice and no-choice dietary regimes in the presence or absence of the toxin, cineole, at a concentration known to limit intake by ∼50\%. We found that possums could compensate for the effect of a high concentration of cineole on food intake if they could mediate dietary concentrations of the HP and HC foods. They appeared to do this by 1) selecting an increased proportion of dietary protein and 2) by continually adjusting the proportion of protein and carbohydrate eaten throughout a feeding night. Our results demonstrate that the protective effect of cineole against herbivory by possums is not a simple function of its concentration but rather depends strongly on the nutritional context in which it occurs.},

	abstract = {Phaedon tumidulus, Germ., is sometimes a pest of celery [see preceding paper]. In experiments the turgid leaves of a healthy plant were not attacked until the beetles were short of food, the almost flaccid leaves of a crop suffering from lack of moisture being preferred. One beetle ate an average of 4.8 sq. mm. of a leaf a day, and the effect of one or two beetles is more than counterbalanced by the daily growth of the plant, but the species is gregarious and concentrates in such numbers that it destroys the plants or seriously impedes their growth. P. armoraciae, L., has been taken on mustard and watercress. The larvae and adults of P. cochleariae, F. (mustard beetle) frequently occur on cruciferous crops [R.A.E., A, xii, 282], congregating in large numbers on each plant and only migrating to the next when the foliage has been entirely consumed. Although the beetles have well-developed wings, they rarely fly, but sometimes crawl long distances from their hibernating quarters to the crops on which they lay their eggs in May and June. The beetles that mature on their food-plants in summer may have some weeks to feed after harvest, so that they are forced to migrate to later crops. When cold weather begins, they crawl to their hibernating quarters. The egg, larva and pupa and the method of oviposition are briefly described. There are two overlapping generations a year; typical seasonal histories for early and late individuals of each are given; in the first generation, adults resulting from eggs laid between 15th May and 26th June emerge between 15th June and 30th July, and adults of the second generation from eggs laid between 23rd June and 10th August emerge between 27th July and 10th September. The habits of P. cochleariae when feeding in watercress beds are described [cf. R.A.E., A, iv, 356]. It was found that the hairs, bristles and tubercles on the body of the larva prevent it from being wetted, and when it reaches the water, it progresses along the surface with an eel-like motion. To control the pest, the plants should be held down with planks and wire netting, so that the beetles float off and drift to the outlet, where they can be scooped out in buckets. Stray individuals passing over the banks may be caught on tarred boards.},

The geographic distribution patterns of the haplotypes were highly structured. We investigated the common phylogeographic patterns between the two species that would indicate the influence of common historical factors such as climate change since the last glacial maximum (LGM). Based on our results, we concluded that the Pacific-type Japanese deciduous broad-leaved forests were split into at least three refugia during the LGM. After the LGM, the species expanded to northern areas or moved to higher altitudes from each refugium, thus now occupying northeastern, central, and southwestern Japan.},

These polysaccharides are known to elicit defense responses in plant and animals and possess anti-viral properties. We investigated the effect of foliar application of ι-, κ- and λ-carrageenans (representing various levels of sulphation) on Arabidopsis thaliana in resistance to the generalist insect Trichoplusia ni (cabbage looper) which is known to cause serious economic losses in crop plants. Plants treated with ι- and κ-carrageenan showed reduced leaf damage, whereas those treated with λ- carrageenan were similar to that of the control. In a no-choice test, larval weight was reduced by more than 20\% in ι- and κ- carrageenan treatments, but unaffected by λ-carrageenan. In multiple choice tests, carrageenan treated plants attracted fewer T. ni larvae by the fourth day following infestation as compared to the control. The application of carrageenans did not affect oviposition behaviour of T. ni. Growth of T. ni feeding on an artificial diet amended with carrageenans was not different from that fed with untreated control diet. ι-carrageenan induced the expression of defense genes; PR1, PDF1.2, and TI1, but κ- and λ-carrageenans did not. Besides PR1, PDF1.2, and TI1, the indole glucosinolate biosynthesis genes CYP79B2, CYP83B1 and glucosinolate hydrolysing QTL, ESM1 were up-regulated by ι-carrageenan treatment at 48 h post infestation. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of carrageenan treated leaves showed increased concentrations of both isothiocyanates and nitriles. Taken together, these results show that carrageenans have differential effects on Arabidopsis resistance to T. ni and that the degree of sulphation of the polysaccharide chain may well mediate this effect.},

	abstract = {• Premise: Although many highly successful weed species use a ballistic seed dispersal mechanism, little is known about the mechanics of this process. Bittercress (Cardamine hirsuta) siliques are morphologically similar to Arabidopsis siliques, but they can project their seeds up to 5 m, while Arabidopsis seeds are dispersed by gravity. Comparison of these species should enable us to determine which structures might be responsible for ballistic seed dispersal.• Methods: Sections of Arabidopsis and bittercress siliques were immunolabeled with antibodies raised against a variety of polysaccharide epitopes.• Results: In bittercress, the second endocarp layer (enB) of the valve had strongly asymmetrical cell wall thickenings, whereas the analogous cells in Arabidopsis were reinforced symmetrically and to a lesser extent. Additionally, an accumulation of mucilaginous pectins was found between the first and second endocarp (enA and enB) layers in the bittercress valve that was not present in Arabidopsis. However, in both species, highly de-esterified homogalacturonan was lost in the dehiscence zone (at the carpel/replum interface) as the siliques matured, thus allowing for separation of the valve at maturity.• Conclusions: Ballistic seed dispersal in bittercress may involve the contraction of the outer pericarp tissue against the highly asymmetrically thickened enB cells, which are hypothesized to bend in one direction preferentially. The stress generated by the differential drying of the inner and outer layers of the valve is released suddenly as the adhesion between the cells of the dehiscence zone is lost, leading to a rapid coiling of the valve and dispersal of the seeds.},

	abstract = {1 Wireworms, the soil dwelling larvae of click beetles, Agriotes spp., have recently become a more prevalent pest of potatoes. The present study investigated whether potato varieties showed variable susceptibility to wireworm herbivory, and also tested whether increased susceptibility was associated with lower concentrations of glycoalkaloids. Twelve varieties were originally screened across a range of experimental scales, including laboratory and tunnel experiments and a large-scale field trial involving over 2000 tubers.2 In laboratory no-choice tests, Maris Peer, Marfona and Rooster varieties were significantly more susceptible to wireworm attack, with 63\% of tubers showing damage, compared with just 15\% of the less susceptible varieties of King Edward, Nadine and Maris Piper. There was also greater tissue consumption and weight gain when wireworms were reared on the most susceptible varieties.3 In choice tests, wireworms showed a significant preference for those varieties previously identified as being the most susceptible to wireworm herbivory (4.2 holes per tuber) compared with the least susceptible (1.2 holes per tuber). Similar patterns of susceptibility were seen in the field trial, although there was generally more variation in susceptibility.4 In a tunnel experiment, Marfona and Maris Peer were significantly more susceptibile to wireworm attack (47\% of tubers showing damage) compared with Nadine, King Edward and Maris Piper (27\% of tubers showing damage). Although Nadine, in particular, had the highest glycoalkaloid concentrations (309.33 mg/kg) and lowest amounts of wireworm herbivory, the relationship between susceptibility and glycoalkaloid concentrations was weak, suggesting that this is unlikely to be the sole mechanism underpinning varietal susceptibility.},

Differences in host plant range and insect community structure were examined with regard to anti-herbivore defense mechanisms. Most of the crucifer species deterred insect herbivory by disappearing in the summer or by lowering their intrinsic quality as food for insects. Species with these defense mechanisms were exploited by only a few specialized herbivorous insects that seemed to have counter defenses. The plants without these defense mechanisms were used by many herbivorous insect species. Rorippa indica lacked direct defenses, but supported a low total density of herbivore individuals. This crucifer has an indirect defense mechanism: ants attracted to floral nectar defended the plant from deleterious herbivores. Crucifers that disappeared seasonally lacked other anti-herbivore defense mechanisms. This suggests that the phonological response is an alternative other responses to herbivore attack.},

	abstract = {Once attacked by herbivores, plants regenerate new leaves with increased trichome density as an inducible defense. Trichomes are specified from neighboring epidermal cells through local cell-cell interactions in the leaf primordia. However, the molecular mechanism of how herbivore-induced damage at older leaves remodels the pattern of trichome fate specification at newly forming leaves is largely unknown. In this study, we show that mutations in either the biosynthetic or signaling pathway of jasmonates (JAs), long-distance wound signals, abolish the wound-induced formation of trichomes. To identify the factors linking JA signaling to trichome fate specification, we isolated a novel class of mutants, unarmed (urm), which lack trichome induction but show otherwise normal responses to JAs. URM9 encodes an Importin β family protein, and URM23 is identical to TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1), the product of which interacts with the bHLH transcription factor GLABRA3 (GL3). Loss of either URM9 or URM23 disrupts the subnuclear localization of GL3, thus implicating GL3 in trichome induction. The expression of GL3 was enhanced by JA treatment prior to trichome initiation. Genetic analysis of multiple trichome mutants shows that GL3, in concert with the R2R3-Myb transcription factor GLABRA1 (GL1), promotes trichome fate in response to JA in a dosage-dependent manner. These results indicate that GL3 is a key transcription factor of wound-induced trichome formation acting downstream of JA signaling in Arabidopsis.},

	abstract = {The polyphagous leafroller moth, Epiphyas postvittana, is a pest of many fruit crops in New Zealand. Since the larva is highly mobile, host selection in this insect may involve both the adult female and the larva. In order to test the relative importance of the adult female and the neonate larva in the selection of host plants, the ovipositional preferences of females, and the preferences or acceptances of neonate larvae towards 26 plant species, consisting of 15 plants considered hosts and 11 not considered hosts, were investigated. In the ovipositional tests, the mean preferences of females for hosts and non-hosts were very similar. In contrast, larvae showed a significantly greater mean preference or acceptance towards hosts than to non-hosts, in both choice and no-choice bioassays, respectively. There were highly significant correlations between the preferences and acceptances of larvae for plants in the choice and no-choice tests. In the no-choice tests, there was a highly significant correlation between the acceptances of neonate larvae towards plants after one and three days (i.e., acceptances changed little over time). Moreover, in these no-choice tests, there was a significant negative correlation between larval acceptance at 1 day and larval mortality after 3 days; that is, the less acceptable a given plant at 1 day, the more likely larvae would fail to establish, feed, and survive on it by three days. Female and larval preferences towards the various plants were also negatively correlated. Together, these data suggest that the selection of a plant for the neonate larva to feed on is largely governed by the preferences of the larva, rather than by the preferences of the female. However, selection of a plant for oviposition by the female, may be important in host selection for reasons unrelated to larval preferences, for example, by encouraging dispersal, perhaps to other plant species, of the neonate larvae and thereby decreasing intersibling competition.},

	abstract = {Models of the dynamics of a predator and two competing prey are examined for conditions under which the predator's presence makes competitive coexistence possible. Despite the fact that the prey in the absence of the predator exploit identical resources, predation-induced coexistence can occur; but its occurrence depends on the prey being different in at least one of several ways. Suitable differences include differences in spatial refuges from the predator, differences in appearance and/or location which induce frequency-dependent predation, and a difference in energy allocation between competitive and predatory defense. Thus these models predict, in keeping with the results of field studies on predators, that predation can play a central role in determining community species composition. However, prey species coexistence still depends on their being somehow different; i.e., Gause's Law is just as true when predators are common and important as when they are absent. Most of those prey in nature whose coexistence is known to depend on predation differ in resource use; i.e., these prey appear to partition environmental resources just as is expected of coexisting species in predator-free systems. A large proportion of cases of coexistence of similar species in nature probably results not from resource partitioning alone or from predation alone but from both mechanisms operating simultaneously.},

(Verbenaceae), with a leaf-mining larval phase and free-living, leaf-chewing adults.Plants grown at elevated CO2 had enhanced above-ground biomass, thicker leaves, reduced nitrogen concentration, and increased C:N ratios. Under the high temperature treatment, plants grown at ambient CO2 suffered wilting and premature leaf loss, despite daily watering; this effect was ameliorated at elevated CO2. The wilting of plants in the ambient CO2/high temperature treatment reduced the emergence success of the beetles, particularly O. championi. Development time was accelerated by approximately 10–13 days at the higher temperature, but was not affected by CO2. Neither CO2 nor temperature affected adult beetle weight. Consumption rates of free-living beetles were not affected by either CO2 or temperature. By contrast, in the short-term trials using excised foliage, beetles given no choice between ambient and elevated CO2-grown foliage, consumed more from ambient plants. When beetles were offered a choice between foliage grown at the two CO2 levels, O. championi did not display a significant preference but O. scabripennis consumed more ambient CO2-grown foliage when feeding at the lower temperature.This study indicates that under future conditions of higher temperatures, amelioration of water stress in host plants growing in elevated CO2 may benefit some endophagous insects by reducing premature leaf loss. Under some circumstances, this benefit may outweigh the deleterious effects of lower leaf nitrogen. Our results also indicate that foliage consumption under elevated CO2 by mobile, adult insects on whole plants may not be significantly increased, as was previously indicated by short-term experiments using excised foliage.},

	abstract = {Many examples of associational resistance have been reported, in which a plant’s neighbors reduce the rate of damage by herbivores that it experiences. Despite 30 years of interest and hundreds of examples of associational resistance, we still know very little about how plants avoid their herbivores. This lack of mechanistic understanding prevents us from predicting when or where associational resistance will be important or might affect species’ distributions. I demonstrate here that the plant neighborhoods that surrounded focal mule’s ears (Wyethia mollis) individuals affected the damage they received. In particular, distance between a focal mule’s ears individual and its nearest sagebrush neighbor (Artemisia tridentata) was a good predictor of how much leaf area the mule’s ears would lose to herbivores over 2 years. Mule’s ears close to sagebrush suffered less loss than those with more distant nearest sagebrush neighbors. Mule’s ears with near sagebrush neighbors suffered half the leaf loss as mule’s ears with sagebrush experimentally removed. This associational resistance was probably not caused by sagebrush attracting or increasing populations of predators of generalist herbivores. Sagebrush is known to emit chemicals that are feeding deterrents to generalist grasshoppers and these deterrents were probably involved here. Volatile chemicals emitted by damaged sagebrush have been found to induce resistance in neighboring plants of several species. However, I found no evidence for such eavesdropping here as mule’s ears gained associational resistance from sagebrush neighbors whether or not those sagebrush neighbors had been experimentally damaged. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for associational resistance is critical to predicting where and when it will be important.},

Such models are widely used to infer community dynamics of sessile organisms because transition probabilities (the elements of transition probability matrices) can be estimated with time series data from “grid sampling,” where species occupancy states are assessed at multiple fixed points in a quadrat or transect. These estimates, however, are known to be biased when resampling error exists. In this study, we used the perspective of multistate dynamic occupancy models to develop a new Markov model that is structured hierarchically such that transitions among occupancy states and observation processes are considered explicitly at each fixed point. We show that, by adopting a hierarchical Bayesian approach, our model provides estimates for transition probabilities that are robust to sampling error. We also show that error rate may be estimated without additional data obtained from rapid repeated sampling. Considerations for the analysis for the application to real data set and potential extensions of the proposed model are discussed.},

Comparative genotyping and phenotyping of nearly 12,000 O. biennis individuals revealed that in plots protected from insects, resistance to herbivores declined through time owing to changes in flowering time and lower defensive ellagitannins in fruits, whereas plant competitive ability increased. This independent real-time evolution of plant resistance and competitive ability in the field resulted from the relaxation of direct selective effects of insects on plant defense and through indirect effects due to reduced herbivory on plant competitors.},

We investigated population genetic structure using nuclear and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and inferred the effects of past population demographic processes and contemporary gene flow. Our cpDNA results revealed a strong pattern of differentiation of four regional groups (coastal California, southern Oregon, Klamath mountains, and Sierra Nevada). The chloroplast haplotype phylogeny suggests relatively deep divergence of Sierra Nevada and Klamath populations from those of coastal California and southern Oregon. A widespread coastal California haplotype may have resulted from multiple refugial sites during the Last Glacial Maximum or from rapid recolonization from few refugia. Analysis of nuclear microsatellites suggests two major groups: (1) central coastal California and (2) Sierra Nevada/Klamath/southern Oregon and an area of admixture in north coastal California. The low level of nuclear differentiation is likely to be due to pollen gene flow among populations during postglacial range expansion.},

	abstract = {Population genetic theory predicts that the self-incompatible and perennial herb, Arabidopsis lyrata, will have a genetic structure that differs from the self-fertilizing, annual Arabidopsis thaliana. We quantified the genetic structure for eight populations of A. lyrata ssp. petraea in historically nonglaciated regions of central Europe. Analysis of 20 microsatellite loci for 344 individuals demonstrated that, in accordance with predictions, diploid populations had high genome-wide heterozygosity (HO = 0.48; HE = 0.52), high within-population diversity (83\% of total) compatible with mutation–drift equilibrium, and moderate differentiation among populations (FST = 0.17). Within a single population, the vast majority of genetic variability (92\%) was found at the smallest spatial scale ({\textbackslash}textless 3 m). Although there was no evidence of biparental inbreeding or clonal propagation at this scale (FIS = 0.003), significant fine-scale spatial autocorrelation indicated localized gene flow presumably due to gravity dispersed seeds (Sp = 0.018). Limited gene flow between isolated population clusters (regions) separated by hundreds of kilometres has given rise to an isolation by distance pattern of diversification, with low, but significant, differentiation among regions (FST = 0.05). The maintenance of geographically widespread polymorphisms and uniformly high diversity throughout central Europe is consistent with periglacial survival of A. lyrata ssp. petraea north of the Alps in steppe-tundra habitats during the last glacial maximum. As expected of northern and previously glaciated localities, A. lyrata in Iceland was genetically less diverse and highly differentiated from central Europe (HE = 0.37; FST = 0.27).},

	abstract = {Herbivorous insects face a dilemma when selecting suitable hosts in a complex environment, and their sensory capability may often reduce the female capacity for proper selection. As a consequence, eggs are often deposited on inferior hosts, affecting both insect and host plant fitness. We examined the attack rates of three cabbage herbivores in monocultures and biculture plots of different Brassica oleracea genotypes, with different spatial heterogeneity. The main goals of the study were to improve our understanding of the spatial scales involved in herbivore search processes and to examine the possibility of using spatial heterogeneity for manipulating pest attack rates in cabbage cropping systems. The results showed that the host selection behaviour of the small white butterfly (Pieris rapae) was strongly dependent on spatial heterogeneity. The difference in egg density between plant genotypes was larger when contrasting plants were growing in close proximity than in monoculture. This suggests that P. rapae is able to differentiate among genotypes from a small distance, while selection is compromised at larger spatial scales. The two other herbivores in the study (Mamestra brassicae and Delia radicum) did not respond to heterogeneity at any spatial scale, but showed a constant preference hierarchy. This suggests that host selection in these species occurs after direct plant contact. The difference in species’ responses to spatial heterogeneity has consequences both for selection gradients in natural communities and for the potential to reduce pest attack in polyculture systems.},

Description of plant responses to environmental quality in terms of foraging is a relatively recent development. Foraging is defined as the processes whereby an organism searches, or ramifies within its habitat, which enhance its acquisition of essential resources. Foraging in plants is accomplished by morphological plasticity. Plasticity is shown by a genotype when its expression is able to be altered by environmental influences. In response to different environmental conditions, morphological plasticity can generate different patterns of spacer production and hence different patterns in the placement of resource-acquiring structures. The chapter concentrates on analysis and interpretation of these patterns and their consequences for future resource acquisition. The chapter discusses the foraging activities of shoots, roots, and fungi. General trends in the foraging activities of plants and their interpretation are also summarized in the chapter. Plant and animal foraging can be fruitfully related by comparing the economics of behavior in relation to the patch structure of the habitat.},

	abstract = {Herbivores commonly base their foraging decisions not only on the intrinsic characteristics of plants, but also on the attributes of neighboring species. Although herbivores commonly orient their food choices toward the maximization of energy intake, the impact of such choices on neighboring plants remains largely unexplored. We evaluated whether foraging decisions by herbivores aiming at a rapid intake of digestible energy could explain multiple neighboring effects in complex swards. Specifically, we assessed how spatial patterns of occurrence of Carex atherodes, a highly profitable sedge species, could control the risk of bison (Bison bison) herbivory for seven other plant species. The foraging behavior of 70 free-ranging bison was evaluated in their natural environment during summer, and then related to plant characteristics. We used this information to estimate the instantaneous intake rate of digestible energy at individual feeding stations. We found that neighbor contrast defense and associational susceptibility can both be explained by simple foraging rules of energy maximization. Energy gains were higher when C. atherodes was consumed while avoiding the species for which we detected neighbor contrast defense. The lower intake rate associated with their consumption was due to an increase in handling time caused by their small size relative to C. atherodes. Bison also had higher energy gains by consuming instead of avoiding the plant species that experienced associational susceptibility. Because most of these plants were at least as tall as C. atherodes, their presence increased the heterogeneity of the grazed stratum. Avoiding their consumption increased handling time thereby reducing the instantaneous rate of energy intake. Overall, we found that bison adjust their fine-scale foraging decisions to vertical and horizontal sward structures in a way that maximizes their energy intake rate. Energy maximization principles thus provide a valuable framework to evaluate a broad-range of neighboring effects for prey faced with generalist consumers.},

In contrast, in the satyrine butterfly Ypthima multistriata Butler, local populations with different voltinism patterns are geographically intermingled, suggesting that life-history traits related to diapause may differ even between geographically and phylogenetically close populations. In this study, we experimentally examined the critical photoperiod for diapause induction and the larval developmental period in two univoltine and two bivoltine populations of Y. multistriata, all of which inhabit virtually the same latitude (34.652–34.750°N). We found that the critical photoperiod for diapause induction was longer in the univoltine populations than in the bivoltine populations. Moreover, the larval period under the long day length treatment was different among populations in both sexes, although significant differences were also detected between populations with the same voltinism. These results indicate that in Y. multistriata, life-history traits related to diapause can not be attributed merely to climatic conditions such as temperature or day length, which depend largely on latitude. Therefore, we suggest that biotic elements, such as leaf toughness, as well as abiotic elements should be taken into account in attempts to explain the enigmatic pattern of geographic variation in the diapause strategies of Y. multistriata.},

	abstract = {Oryzias latipes (medaka) has been established as a vertebrate genetic model for more than a century and recently has been rediscovered outside its native Japan. The power of new sequencing methods now makes it possible to reinvigorate medaka genetics, in particular by establishing a near-isogenic panel derived from a single wild population. Here we characterize the genomes of wild medaka catches obtained from a single Southern Japanese population in Kiyosu as a precursor for the establishment of a near-isogenic panel of wild lines. The population is free of significant detrimental population structure and has advantageous linkage disequilibrium properties suitable for the establishment of the proposed panel. Analysis of morphometric traits in five representative inbred strains suggests phenotypic mapping will be feasible in the panel. In addition, high-throughput genome sequencing of these medaka strains confirms their evolutionary relationships on lines of geographic separation and provides further evidence that there has been little significant interbreeding between the Southern and Northern medaka population since the Southern/Northern population split. The sequence data suggest that the Southern Japanese medaka existed as a larger older population that went through a relatively recent bottleneck approximately 10,000 years ago. In addition, we detect patterns of recent positive selection in the Southern population. These data indicate that the genetic structure of the Kiyosu medaka samples is suitable for the establishment of a vertebrate near-isogenic panel and therefore inbreeding of 200 lines based on this population has commenced.

	abstract = {In many insect host–parasitoid systems, both the host and its parasitoids forage on shared floral resources. As a result of insect behaviour, morphology and physiology, flower species may act selectively at different levels of such systems, e.g., between the trophic levels of hosts and parasitoids, between species within a guild, between sexes or individuals within a species or between life history traits within an individual. We asked if effects of selectivity are consistent across levels in the horse chestnut leafminer, Cameraria ohridella, and its parasitoid complex. Insects were exposed singly in no-choice feeding trials to twelve common flower species and their survival and reproduction were recorded. Only one of twelve flower species (Ranunculus acris) tended to selectively favour the longevity of leafminers, but not of parasitoids. No flower species were found to favour parasitoids only. Both trophic levels profited from feeding on Anthriscus sylvestris, however, parasitoids benefited up to eight times more than their hosts. No differences were found among the species of the parasitoid guild, but females lived significantly longer than males, and single individuals within species were able to exploit generally unfavourable flower species. Out of the seven flower species that increased the longevity of leafminer females, only Chaerophyllum hirsutum significantly enhanced the number of eggs laid. Fecundity was generally positively correlated with longevity of leafminer females, but two flower species (C. hirsutum, Taraxacum officinale) had an additional positive effect on fecundity. In conclusion, we demonstrated that flowers act differently on life history traits in a host–parasitoid system at a multitude of biological levels and that these effects are not always consistent across levels. Selective plant-derived resources can therefore modify herbivore–natural enemy interactions in ways that are more complex than currently appreciated.},

	abstract = {The process of coevolution between host and enemy has traditionally been viewed as an evolutionary arms race between resistance and counterresistance. The arms-race metaphor of coevolution is widely accepted because it explains the evolution of many characters in species involved in host–enemy interactions. However, molecular work in plant–pathogen systems suggests a coevolutionary interplay between plant recognition of an attacking pathogen and pathogen evasion from recognition. We refer to this process as information coevolution, and contrast this with arms race coevolution to show that these two processes result in very different patterns of host resistance and enemy virulence at the population level. First, information coevolution results in a lower proportion of hosts that are susceptible to enemy attack within a population. Second, information coevolution produces a pattern of local maladaptation of enemy on host, a naturally occurring phenomenon that is difficult to explain under arms race coevolution. We then conduct a literature review to survey the empirical support for either mode of coevolution using the predicted patterns of host resistance and enemy virulence. Evidence supports both modes of coevolution in plant–enemy interactions, whereas no support is found for information coevolution in vertebrate–parasite and invertebrate–parasite systems.},

The variation in elaiosomes’ fatty acid composition of this species was studied at three hierarchical levels (sub-individual, individual and population) in four populations from the Iberian Peninsula. We found that differences in fruit location on the inflorescence do not seem to influence the fatty acid composition of elaiosomes, providing to each propagule an equal chance of being dispersed. However, significant differences in elaiosome fatty acid composition between individuals and populations were found for most of the compounds identified. The content of oleic acid, a key mediator in the ant–seed interaction, differed widely between populations, probably reflecting geographic variations in co-adaptation between plants and their dispersers. The finding that the fatty acid composition of E. characias elaiosomes is distinct from that of the seed itself, but very similar to that of elaiosomes from unrelated species, reinforces the idea of convergent evolution in the chemical composition of these structures.},

We expect that use of resistant barley will result in decreased parasitoid abundance as aphid densities decrease. However, parasitism rates are expected to be approximately equal on resistant and susceptible barley. In this system, plant resistance and biocontrol are compatible management strategies.},

	abstract = {Allocation is one of the central concepts in modern ecology, providing the basis for different strategies. Allocation in plants has been conceptualized as a proportional or ratio-driven process (‘partitioning’). In this view, a plant has a given amount of resources at any point in time and it allocates these resources to different structures. But many plant ecological processes are better understood in terms of growth and size than in terms of time. In an allometric perspective, allocation is seen as a size-dependent process: allometry is the quantitative relationship between growth and allocation. Therefore most questions of allocation should be posed allometrically, not as ratios or proportions. Plants evolve allometric patterns in response to numerous selection pressures and constraints, and these patterns explain many behaviours of plant populations. In the allometric view, plasticity in allocation can be understood as a change in a plant's allometric trajectory in response to the environment. Some allocation patterns show relatively fixed allometric trajectories, varying in different environments primarily in the speed at which the trajectory is travelled, whereas other allocation patterns show great flexibility in their behaviour at a given size. Because plant growth is often indeterminate and its rate highly influenced by environmental conditions, ‘plasticity in size’ is not a meaningful concept. We need a new way to classify, describe and analyze plant allocation and plasticity because the concepts ‘trait’ and ‘plasticity’ are too broad. Three degrees of plasticity can be distinguished: (1) allometric growth (‘apparent plasticity’), (2) modular proliferation and local physiological adaptation, and (3) integrated plastic responses. Plasticity, which has evolved because it increases individual fitness, can be a disadvantage in plant production systems, where we want to optimize population, not individual, performance.},

	abstract = {There are many possible spatial patterns of selection and gene flow that can produce a given cline structure; the actual geography of natural selection and gene flow must be worked out before an attempt is made to explain a given natural cline in terms of a model.The results of experimental and theoretical models show that it is possible for local differentiation to evolve parapatrically in spite of considerable gene flow if the selection gradients are relatively uniform. Irregularities in environmental gradients increase the sensitivity of clines to the effects of gene flow in proportion to the increase in the differences in gene frequencies between the emigrants and the demes receiving the immigrants. It is not necessary for a sharp spatial environmental change to be present for distinct differentiation to occur. In some cases even a gentle environmental gradient can give rise to marked spatial differentiation along a genetically continuous series of demes; such environmental differences may be below the practical limits of resolution in field studies. Any asymmetry in gene flow does not lead to dedifferentiation if the environmental gradient is smooth; it merely shifts the position of the transition zone between the differentiated areas from that which would be expected if there were no asymmetry. Abrupt geographic differences in gene, genotype, or morph frequencies should not, therefore, be interpreted as evidence for environmental changes in the immediate vicinity of the steepest part of the cline; neither should they be interpreted as evidence for geographic barriers, sharp environmental differences, or sexual isolation among the differentiated groups of populations when there are no other sources of evidence for these phenomena. Gene flow may be unimportant in the differentiation of populations along environmental gradients.},

Thus it is important to understand the dynamics of wild populations at a scale relevant to single plants. We analyzed over 1,000 individuals from 77 ecologically diverse stands near Tübingen in Southwestern Germany. By assaying hundreds of independent markers in their genomes, we generated an unprecedentedly detailed view of local relatedness and recombination patterns. As has been observed previously for Arabidopsis thaliana and other self-compatible plants, even closely neighboring stands were strongly differentiated. Nevertheless, individuals tended to be most closely related to near neighbors, and footprints of recent recombination events were apparent. Structure was evident within stands, suggesting short dispersal ranges and the potential for nearest neighbor mating to reduce heterozygosity. We also observed differences between stands in rural and urban settings: stands in species-rich rural sites had higher average genetic diversity and presented more evidence of past and ongoing outcrossing than their species-poor urban counterparts. Thus novel combinations of genes may primarily arise in a subset of stands that act as “outcrossing hotspots,” while others contribute little to increasing genetic diversity.},

	abstract = {1. Arthropod communities are structured by complex interactions between bottom-up (resource-based) and top-down (natural enemy-based) forces. Their relative importance in shaping arthropod communities, however, continues to be under debate. Bottom-up and top-down forces can be affected by intraspecific plant variation, for example by differences in concentrations of secondary metabolites that affect herbivore abundance through plant quality (bottom-up) or attract natural enemies of these herbivores (top-down).2. Our objective was to investigate whether herbivore abundance is more strongly affected by plant-mediated bottom-up or top-down forces.3. We used a model system of four cultivars of Brassica oleracea that show a high degree of variation in several plant traits, resistance to herbivores and attraction of natural enemies. During two field seasons, we recorded the abundance of several herbivorous and carnivorous insect species. To assess the relative importance of bottom-up and top-down forces, we quantified chemical and morphological traits of the cultivars (bottom-up) and assessed parasitization of herbivores and predator oviposition on plants inoculated with a controlled number of herbivores (top-down).4. We show that intraspecific variation in plant chemistry and morphology consistently affects the abundance of insect herbivores and their natural enemies, resulting in cascading effects on tritrophic interactions in the associated insect community. Foliar profiles of glucosinolates and leaf toughness appeared most important for these effects. Brassica oleracea cultivars that harboured the largest numbers of herbivores also harboured the largest numbers of natural enemies. Differences in the fraction of herbivores parasitized and in predator oviposition on plants inoculated with a controlled number of herbivores could not explain the differences in natural abundance of herbivores.5. Although abundance of herbivores is most likely influenced by a combination of bottom-up and top-down forces, it appears that in the tritrophic system investigated, bottom-up forces (plant chemistry and morphology) were more important for herbivore abundance than plant-mediated top-down forces (attraction and arrestment of natural enemies).},

	abstract = {A method is presented for estimating the average fitness of a population which is responding to selection in a fluctuating environment. The environment is assumed to be a stationary Markov random process of the type described by Uhlenbeck \& Ornstein (1930), and the genotype is restricted to a single locus with two alleles. The fitness of each genotype depends on the deviation of its phenotype from the optimal phenotype in the given environment. Finally the fitness of the population is expressed as a function of the parameters of the genetic system (average phenotypic effect of a gene substitution, mutation rate) and of the environment (mean, variance, and autocorrelation). Conditions were found under which it is advantageous for a population to be polymorphic (that is, under which the average phenotypic effect of a gene substitution should differ from zero for maximum fitness). These conditions are of two very different kinds. First, regardless of whether the environment is autocorrelated or not, phenotypic diversity is advantageous if the environment is sufficiently heterogeneous compared to the tolerance of an individual for non-optimal conditions. When W(Cz) is the fitness of a genotype whose phenotype differs from the optimum phenotype by z, the tolerance is defined as the distance from the peak (at z = 0) to the point of inflection of W(Cz). Since W(z) has its inflection at some z0, the tolerance of each genotype is z0/C, and C is an inverse measure of homeostasis. If the environment consists of discrete niches or is bimodal with modes (or optimal phenotypes in the niches) further apart than z0/C, it is sufficiently heterogeneous for polymorphism to be optimal. This kind of polymorphism is stable. The different genotypes should be retained in the same frequencies without responding to selection, so that the optimal genetic system will be one in which there is large genetic variance due to epistatic interactions but a minimal additive component. The second kind of optimal polymorphism occurs when there is a high autocorrelation in the environment. Here the advantage of genetic variance is only that it permits response to selection. Thus it will consist mostly of additive variance. These two kinds of optimal polymorphism have very different consequences for speciation. In the first case, recombination between populations will result in F2 breakdown, so that natural selection will tend toward the establishment of isolating mechanisms. Therefore we expect that groups in which there is low individual tolerance of suboptimal environment will have high levels of static polymorphism based on epistatic complexes, a high degree of F2 breakdown, and a high rate of speciation. In the second case, where additive variance predominates, F2 between populations is more or less intermediate and there is not any strong selection for isolation. Hence a high individual tolerance of non-optimal environments will be accompanied by genetic systems with more additive variance, fewer inversions holding epistatic blocks, low F2 breakdown, and a low rate of speciation. It is suggested that the willistoni group of sibling species and Drosphila melanogaster are representatives of these alternative systems of adaptation.},

	abstract = {* 1The vine weevil Otiorhynchus sulcatus is a major pest of horticultural crops worldwide, with root-feeding larvae causing most damage. Adult oviposition aboveground may therefore influence levels of damage as the larvae are relatively immobile after oviposition. * 2The present study investigated feeding and oviposition behaviour on red raspberry Rubus idaeus using intact plants, ensuring that choices reflected the realistic differences in cultivar appearance and chemical composition. Previous studies investigating vine weevil feeding and oviposition on other crops have used excised plant material, which may inadvertently influence behaviour. * 3Adult weevils significantly preferred to feed on particular cultivars in the choice experiment (e.g. Tulameen), although they consumed significantly more foliage (0.22–1.03 cm2/day) on different raspberry cultivars (e.g. Glen Moy, Glen Rosa and a wild accession) in no-choice situations. * 4In choice experiments, weevils tended to avoid laying eggs on some cultivars (e.g. Glen Moy and the wild accession). The number of eggs laid (1.91–4.32 eggs per day) did not, however, differ significantly between the cultivars in a no-choice situation. Foliar nitrogen and magnesium concentrations were positively, although weakly, correlated with the total number of eggs laid. * 5The present study highlights the importance of considering both choice and no-choice tests when assessing crop susceptibility to attack because weevils may avoid feeding on certain cultivars (e.g. Glen Moy) when given a choice, although this would cause significant damage to such cultivars if they were grown in monoculture (i.e. when there is no alternative).},

	abstract = {Plants are often attacked by multiple enemies, including pathogens and herbivores. While many plant secondary metabolites show specific effects toward either pathogens or herbivores, some can affect the performance of both these groups of natural enemies and are considered to be “generalized defense compounds”. We tested whether aucubin and catalpol, two iridoid glycosides present in ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata), confer in vivo resistance to both the generalist insect herbivore Spodoptera exigua and the biotrophic fungal pathogen Diaporthe adunca using plants from P. lanceolata lines that had been selected for high- and low-leaf iridoid glycoside concentrations for four generations. The lines differed approximately three-fold in the levels of these compounds. Plants from the high-selection line showed enhanced resistance to both S. exigua and D. adunca, as evidenced by a smaller lesion size and a lower fungal growth rate and spore production, and a lower larval growth rate and herbivory under both choice and no-choice conditions. Gravimetric analysis revealed that the iridoid glycosides acted as feeding deterrents to S. exigua, thereby reducing its food intake rate, rather than having post-ingestive toxic effects as predicted from in vitro effects of hydrolysis products. We suggest that the bitter taste of iridoid glycosides deters feeding by S. exigua, whereas the hydrolysis products formed after tissue damage following fungal infection mediate pathogen resistance. We conclude that iridoid glycosides in P. lanceolata can serve as broad-spectrum defenses and that selection for pathogen resistance could potentially result in increased resistance to generalist insect herbivores and vice versa, resulting in diffuse rather than pairwise coevolution.},

Underlying much of population genetics is the analysis of variation at selectively neutral marker loci, and microsatellites continue to be a popular choice of marker. In recent decades, software programs to estimate population genetics parameters have been developed at an increasing pace as computational science and theoretical knowledge advance. Numerous population genetics software programs are presently available to analyze microsatellite genotype data, but only a handful are commonly employed for calculating parameters such as genetic variation, genetic structure, patterns of spatial and temporal gene flow, population demography, individual population assignment, and genetic relationships within and between populations. In this chapter, we introduce statistical analyses and relevant population genetic software programs that are commonly employed in the field of population genetics and molecular ecology.},

	abstract = {1. Plant genotypic diversity has important consequences for a variety of ecosystem processes, yet empirical evidence for its effects on productivity, one of the most fundamental of these processes, is lacking. In addition, the performance of insect herbivores in response to high genotypic diversity is unknown, despite previous work demonstrating differential herbivore performance among plant genotypes. 2. We manipulated genotypic diversity of the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana in both the presence and absence of the generalist herbivore Trichoplusia ni under semi-natural growth conditions. We used nine genotypes (eight ecotypes and one mutant) of A. thaliana known to differ widely in functional traits. Productivity and insect biomass were measured in monocultures and mixtures of all nine genotypes grown at multiple fertilization levels and planting densities. 3. In both the absence and presence of herbivores, genotypic diversity increased plant productivity and survival. This effect was, for the most part, independent of fertility or density. Sampling or selection effects did not appear to be wholly responsible for these results as all genotypes were maintained in equal proportion and no single genotype became dominant for the duration of the experiment. 4. High diversity increased T. ni biomass and survival in all treatments. Insect biomass was positively, but not tightly, correlated to plant biomass, indicating that the higher herbivore performance observed in genotypic mixtures was only partially due to higher productivity. 5.Synthesis. Our data support the idea that even within a single plant species, genotypic diversity can exert strong influences on both the producer and herbivore communities. The exact mechanisms responsible for these effects and the relative importance of genotypic diversity in natural communities warrant further investigation.},

Studies on Ceratitis capitata, a world fruit pest, can aid the implementation of control programs by determining the plants with higher vulnerability to attacks and plants able to sustain their population in areas of fly distribution. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the influence of eight tropical fruits on the following biological and behavioral parameters of C. capitata: emergence percentage, life cycle duration, adult size, egg production, longevity, fecundity, egg viability, and oviposition acceptance. The fruits tested were: acerola (Malpighia glabra L.), cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.), star fruit (Averrhoa carambola L.), guava (Psidium guajava L.), soursop (Annona muricata L.), yellow mombin (Spondias mombin L.), Malay apple (Syzygium malaccense L.), and umbu (Spondias tuberosa L.). The biological parameters were obtained by rearing the recently hatched larvae on each of the fruit kinds. Acceptance of fruits for oviposition experiment was assessed using no-choice tests, as couples were exposed to two pieces of the same fruit. The best performances were obtained with guava, soursop, and star fruit. Larvae reared on cashew and acerola fruits had regular performances. No adults emerged from yellow mombin, Malay apple, or umbu. Fruit species did not affect adult longevity, female fecundity, or egg viability. Guava, soursop, and acerola were preferred for oviposition, followed by star fruit, Malay apple, cashew, and yellow mombin. Oviposition did not occur on umbu. In general, fruits with better larval development were also more accepted for oviposition.},

	abstract = {The consequences of elevated CO2 on plant growth have been well studied on individual plants. The response of a more complex system with several plants interacting is less understood-a situation that limits our capacity to predict the response of natural plant communities. In this study we analyzed the effect of CO2 enrichment on intergenotypic competition in Arabidopsis thaliana. Seeds of five genotypes collected from different natural populations were used. Each genotype was cultivated in a pure stand and in a mixture with each of the other four genotypes in two CO2 conditions (ambient and elevated). At harvest time, genotype fitness was estimated by the number of fruits and seeds produced per plant. At current levels of CO2, genotypes performed better in a pure stand than in a mixture. Kin selection, associated with the low seed dispersal and autogamous reproductive regime of A. thaliana, is invoked to explain these positive responses among plants of similar genotype. Surprisingly, in a high-CO2 atmosphere (700 μL/L) the reverse situation was observed: plants performed better in mixtures than in pure stands. Positive frequency-dependent selection under ambient CO2 concentration became negative under elevated CO2, which could lead more easily to the maintenance of genetic variation. This hypothesis was tested with a simple model of competition. At equilibrium, the simulation did not show coexistence among more genotypes under elevated CO2 than under ambient CO2 concentration. However, this study allows predictions about evolutionary trajectories under high-CO2 conditions. In A. thaliana, genotypes that will maintain the most their ability to grow well in pure stand should be selected under increasing CO2.},

	abstract = {Aims Early models of plant defense conceived resistance and tolerance to herbivore damage as mutually exclusive strategies. Support for this idea has been equivocal and studies on these two strategies are still needed to understand the evolution of defenses in natural populations. In Arabidopsis lyrata, the production of trichomes, a documented resistance trait, has been associated with a fitness cost in the absence of herbivores. We examined whether trichome production is also associated with reduced tolerance to simulated herbivore damage. Methods We conducted a field experiment in a natural Swedish population of A. lyrata where we inflicted leaf (0 vs. 50\% of the area of each leaf removed) and inflorescence damage (0 vs. 50\% of inflorescences removed) to trichome-producing and glabrous plants in a factorial design. We examined the response (survival, growth and reproduction) of the plants to the imposed damage over 2 years. Important Findings Trichome-producing plants were not less tolerant than glabrous plants to simulated herbivore damage (no significant morph × leaf damage or morph × inflorescence damage interactions). Inflorescence and leaf damage had independent negative effects on the performance of damaged plants. Leaf damage reduced rosette size the year of damage, but effects on reproductive output in the year of damage, and on survival and reproductive performance the following year were weak and not statistically significant. Inflorescence damage significantly reduced the number of flowers, fruits and seeds the year of damage, but not in the following year. Irrespective of morph, the study population was more tolerant to leaf than to inflorescence damage. The results indicated no trade-off between trichome production and tolerance, suggesting that these two defense mechanisms have the potential to evolve independently in this A. lyrata population.},

	abstract = {Evolution under the multilocus Levene model is investigated. The linkage map is arbitrary, but epistasis is absent. The geometric-mean fitness, w ̃ ( ρ ) , depends only on the vector of gene frequencies, ρ ; it is nondecreasing, and the single-generation change is zero only on the set, Λ , of gametic frequencies at gene-frequency equilibrium. The internal gene-frequency equilibria are the stationary points of w ̃ ( ρ ) . If the equilibrium points ρ ˆ of ρ ( t ) (where t denotes time in generations) are isolated, as is generic, then ρ ( t ) converges as t → ∞ to some ρ ˆ . Generically, ρ ( t ) converges to a local maximum of w ̃ ( ρ ) . Write the vector of gametic frequencies, p , as ( ρ , d ) T , where d represents the vector of linkage disequilibria. If ρ ˆ is a local maximum of w ̃ ( ρ ) , then the equilibrium point ( ρ ˆ , 0 ) T is asymptotically stable. If either there are only two loci or there is no dominance, then d ( t ) → 0 globally as t → ∞ . In the second case, w ̃ ( ρ ) has a unique maximum ρ ˆ and ( ρ ˆ , 0 ) T is globally asymptotically stable. If underdominance and overdominance are excluded, and if at each locus, the degree of dominance is deme independent for every pair of alleles, then the following results also hold. There exists exactly one stable gene-frequency equilibrium (point or manifold), and it is globally attracting. If an internal gene-frequency equilibrium exists, it is globally asymptotically stable. On Λ , (i) the number of demes, Γ , is a generic upper bound on the number of alleles present per locus; and (ii) if every locus is diallelic, generically at most Γ − 1 loci can segregate. Finally, if migration and selection are completely arbitrary except that the latter is uniform (i.e., deme independent), then every uniform selection equilibrium is a migration-selection equilibrium and generically has the same stability as under pure selection.},

This paper provides the first comprehensive review of the observed and projected impacts of climate change on plant and animal species in Japan, drawing extensively from both local and international publications. There were a number of long-term data sets on phenological and distributional changes covering more than five decades. Observed phenology records showed two characteristic trends in Japan; greater shifts of plant phenology in autumn relative to spring and delays in insect appearance dates in spring. Distribution records of insect and marine species indicated poleward range expansions of 18–140 km per decade. Future projections on phenology suggested varied responses between species and possible disruptions in ecosystem functions, while those on distributions indicated potential significant range reductions and changes in species assemblages and diversity. Some of these responses are not in line with the global trends while others show changes of greater magnitude than for other regions, which highlights the importance of region-specific climate change impact assessments. The research recommends that, to improve the evaluation of climate change impacts in countries where the common languages are not English, search efforts should be expanded to include locally available data and publications. This can be facilitated by using country-specific journal databases and increasing collaboration with local researchers.},

	abstract = {Natural oak regeneration is poor in Missouri's forests. The potential of the Asiatic oak weevil to affect Missouri's oak resource was addressed by determining the weevil's host plant preference for 10 common Missouri tree species. Host plant preference was assessed in two-choice feeding experiments and no-choice longevity and oviposition experiments. Changes in host plant preference because of previous feeding experience also was investigated. Black oak, red oak, white oak, and sugar maple were acceptable hosts for adult weevils because measurable feeding occurred on these species during two-choice preference tests. In 1985, significantly more leaf was consumed from each oak species than from sugar maple. Leaf consumption for sugar maple and black oak did not differ in 1986. Adults fed red oak and black oak in no-choice tests lived significantly longer and laid significantly more eggs than weevils fed white oak or sugar maple, indicating that red and black oaks were preferred hosts. Of the other species tested, ash, basswood, dogwood, elm, hickory, and sassafras were considered nonhosts because adults did not feed or oviposit when restricted to these tree species. Sugar maple and white oak were acceptable but not preferred hosts because longevity and egg production were reduced when weevils fed on these species. A feeding preference for white oak and sugar maple could not induced in adults by an earlier feeding experience on these hosts.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/2406873},
	abstract = {Colias butterflies living in cold climates display great darkening of their hindwing undersides, but those in warm climates do not. Many populations of Colias have been studied to test the hypothesis that this darkening increases the efficiency of absorption of solar energy for heating, and thus promotes activity, hence reproductive success, in cold environments. Colias' body temperatures were monitored by the chronic implantation of minute thermistor probes, and the following results were obtained: 1) Below body temperatures of 34-35 C, Colias at rest orient to present their hindwing undersides perpendicular to the sun's rays, presenting maximum surface area for energy absorption. The thorax and abdomen lie directly beneath the area of greatest darkening on the wing. Above temperatures of 37-38 C, Colias at rest orient parallel to the sun's rays, presenting minimal surface area, and also seek shade. 2) All Colias show a similar voluntary activity range (VAR). The lower limit of this is 28-30 C; the upper limit lies above 40-42 C. Populations in cold habitats have not adapted by lowering the lower limit of the VAR, i.e. flying at lower temperatures. The optimum activity range (OAR) of Colias appears to be 35-38 C. 3) Colias display no mechanisms for facultative warming by metabolic or muscular heating, nor for facultative cooling by evaporation. 4) If a light and a dark Colias of the same mass and surface area are exposed side by side to solar radiation, the dark insect heats significantly faster, and attains higher steady-state body temperature, than does the light insect. These differences persist, both in direction and size, after death, and thus cannot be caused by any metabolic agency. Since light and dark forms lose heat at the same rates in cooling rate studies, the heating difference must result from greater solar energy absorption by dark insects. Reflectance spectrophotometry was performed on light and dark Colias wings at visible, near-infrared and infrared wavelengths. The energy absorption advantage of the dark forms over the light, as revealed by spectrophotometry, is wholly consistent with the heating rate advantage found in the thermistor studies. It is shown that, in cold alpine or northern habitats, dark Colias must achieve greater reproductive success than light Colias, since their solar heating advantage will lead to greater activity for feeding, mating, and oviposition. The reverse is true in warm lowland habitats, where light Colias will be less susceptible than dark ones to heat stress and resulting forced inactivity. Means for estimating the strength of these selective forces, and other forces which might act on underside color in Colias, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Several studies have shown that consumption of a focal plant by herbivores depends not only on its own defense traits but also on the characteristics of the neighboring plants. A number of studies have reported on plant associational defense in relation to neighboring plant palatability but the effect of the spatial distribution of the focal plant within patches of different neighboring plants has received less attention. We conducted a manipulative experiment to determine whether and how spatial distribution of focal plants affects the associational defense between plant species. In our experimental setup sheep encountered two patches varying in spatial distribution of the focal plant within patches (dispersed or clumped) and patch quality, good patch and bad patch, where the focal plant, Lathyrus quinquenervius, was neighbored to high- (Chloris virgata) or low-palatable (Kalimeris integrifolia) species, respectively. Results showed that, when focal plants were dispersed within both patches, the risk of attack was significantly lower for focal plants in the patches with low- than high-palatable neighbors, indicating associational defense. Alternatively, when focal plants were clumped within both patches, they were consumed in bad-patch as much as in good-patch plots, which indicates the absence of associational defense. However, if the focal plants have different spatial distributions in the two patches (dispersed in good-patch and clumped in bad-patch or vice versa), sheep foraging success for focal plants was greatly reduced in dispersed spatial pattern irrespective of the palatability of neighboring plants. Therefore, we concluded that spatial distribution is as important as traits of neighboring plants in predicting vulnerability of the focal plant to grazing by generalist herbivores. The outcome of plant associational defense for different types of neighborhood strongly depends on the magnitude of herbivore foraging selectivity between and within patches, which further depended on the contrasts between plant species or between patches.},

	abstract = {Selection on floral traits in hermaphrodite plants can operate through either male or female sex function. However, selection is typically measured for the female component only, and when selection through male function is measured, it is usually done only in terms of pollen removal from flowers. We tested whether selection on floral spur length might differ between genders in the orchid Satyrium longicauda by measuring the effect of spur length manipulations on pollen receipt and export of color-labeled pollen to conspecific stigmas. This was done in two populations with different pollinator faunas to determine whether pollinator context influenced the relationship between spur length and gender-specific fitness components. In one population, spur length manipulation had opposite effects on sex functions, while in the other, both pollen export and receipt were reduced by spur shortening. Furthermore, measures of male function through pollen removal and pollen export did not always correspond. These results suggest that selection on floral spur length can differ between genders and that this gender bias may be affected by the pollinator context. Furthermore, interpretation of selection through male function based only on pollen removal can lead to erroneous conclusions. The context dependence of gender differences in selection could be an important factor generating geographically structured divergence in floral traits and, ultimately, speciation.},

Here, we report for the first time frequency-dependent RI in a pair of native and alien dandelions: Taraxacum japonicum and T. officinale, respectively. Taraxacum japonicum has been displaced rapidly by the alien congener T. officinale in Japan and its causal mechanism are still poorly understood. Field observations revealed that the seed-set of natives decreased substantially as the proportion of alien neighbors increased. Subsequently, in a field experiment, the removal of alien flowers only greatly increased the seed-set of natives. We synthesized these results with existing theoretical models of RI and concluded that RI, which is mediated by strong frequency dependence, is presumably responsible for the displacement of T. japonicum by T. officinale.},

When resource are limited, plants with inherently slow growth are favored over those with fast growth rates; slow rates in turn favor large investments in antiherbivore defenses. Leaf lifetime, also determined by resource availability, affects the relative advantages of defenses with different turnover rates. Relative limitation of different resources also constrains the types of defenses. The proposals are compared with other theories on the evolution of plant defenses.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/2640435},
	abstract = {Ecological factors that reduce the effectiveness of cross-pollination are likely to play a role in the frequent evolution of routine self-fertilization in flowering plants. However, we lack empirical evidence linking the reproductive assurance value of selfing in poor pollination environments to evolutionary shifts in mating system. Here, we investigated the adaptive significance of prior selfing in the polymorphic annual plant Arenaria uniflora (Caryophyllaceae), in which selfer populations occur only in areas of range overlap with congener A. glabra. To examine the hypothesis that secondary contact between the two species contributed to the evolution and maintenance of selfing, we used field competition experiments and controlled hand-pollinations to measure the female fitness consequences of pollinator-mediated interspecific interactions. Uniformly high fruit set by selfers in the naturally pollinated field arrays confirmed the reproductive assurance value of selfing, whereas substantial reductions in outcrosser fruit set (15\%) and total seed production (20-35\%) in the presence of A. glabra demonstrated that pollinator-mediated interactions can provide strong selection for self-pollination. Heterospecific pollen transfer, rather than competition for pollinator service, appears to be the primary mechanism of pollinator-mediated competition in Arenaria. Premating barriers to hybridization between outcrossers and A. glabra are extremely weak. The production of a few inviable hybrid seeds after heterospecific pollination and intermediate seed set after mixed pollinations indicates that A. glabra pollen can usurp A. uniflora ovules. Thus, any visit to A. uniflora by shared pollinators carries a potential female fitness cost. Moreover, patterns of fruit set and seed set in the competition arrays relative to controls were consistent with the receipt of mixed pollen loads, rather than a lack of pollinator visits. Competition through pollen transfer favors preemptive self-pollination and may be responsible for the evolution of a highly reduced floral morphology in A. uniflora selfers as well as their current geographical distribution.},

For this to be true, herbivores must also cause short-term evolution within plant populations, but few studies have experimentally tested this prediction. We addressed this gap using a long-term manipulative field experiment where exclosures protected 22 plant populations from natural rabbit herbivory for {\textbackslash}textless1 to 26 years. We collected seeds of Rumex acetosa L. (Polygonaceae) from our plots and grew them in a common greenhouse environment to quantify evolved differences among populations in individual plant growth rate, tolerance to herbivory, competitive ability, and the concentration of secondary metabolites (tannins and oxalate) implicated in defense against herbivores. In 26 years without rabbit herbivory, plant growth rate decreased linearly by 30\%. We argue that plant growth rate has evolved as a defense against intense rabbit herbivory. In contrast, we found no change in tolerance to herbivory or concentrations of secondary metabolites. We also found no change in competitive ability, suggesting that contemporary evolution may not feed back to alter ecological interactions within this plant community. Our results combined with those of other studies show that the evolution of gross morphological traits such as growth rate in response to herbivory may be common, which calls into question assumptions about some of the most popular theories of plant defense.},

It is of interest to determine which factors shape the distribution of insects over the leaves of a plant. Do leaves from different positions differ in suitability for insects and is that reflected in the insect's preference, or are other factors involved? In this paper we assess how the herbivorous insect western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), chooses among leaves from different positions relative to the apex of cucumber, Cucumis sativus (L.) plants. On leaf discs of a susceptible and three partially resistant cucumber accessions, thrips reproduction was highest on apical leaves and lowest on basal leaves. In dual-choice essays thrips females preferred younger leaves over older leaves for oviposition in all cucumber accessions tested, as was predicted from the no-choice assay. This indicates that differences in leaf suitability are an important factor in determining thrips distribution on cucumber plants.},

It involves little more than sampling from full conditional distributions, which can be both complex and computationally expensive to evaluate. Gilks and Wild have shown that in practice full conditionals are often log-concave, and they proposed a method of adaptive rejection sampling for efficiently sampling from univariate log-concave distributions. In this paper, to deal with non-log-concave full conditional distributions, we generalize adaptive rejection sampling to include a Hastings-Metropolis algorithm step. One important field of application in which statistical models may lead to non-log-concave full conditionals is population pharmacokinetics. Here, the relationship between drug dose and blood or plasma concentration in a group of patients typically is modelled by using non-linear mixed effects models. Often, the data used for analysis are routinely collected hospital measurements, which tend to be noisy and irregular. Consequently, a robust (t-distributed) error structure is appropriate to account for outlying observations and/or patients. We propose a robust non-linear full probability model for population pharmacokinetic data.

The factors were outcrossing rate, within-population spatial genetic structure, census size and substrate type. The expected heterozygosity (HE) at 10 microsatellite loci was taken to reflect the effective population size (Ne) and the strength of genetic drift. * •The mating system explained most of the variation in HE (60\%), followed by substrate (10\%), genetic structure (9\%) and census size (6\%). The most outcrossing population had a +0.32 higher predicted HE than the most selfing population; the estimated Ne of selfing populations was less than half that of outcrossing populations. Rocky outcrops supported populations with a +0.14 higher HE than did sandy substrates. The most structured population had a +0.24 higher HE than the least structured population, and the largest population had a +0.18 higher HE than the smallest population. * •This study illustrates the importance of outcrossing, genetic structure and the physical environment – together with census size – in maintaining HE, and suggests that multiple population-level characteristics influence Ne and the action of genetic drift.},

Using a model Populus system in a common garden with replicated clones of known genotypes, we evaluated microbial biomass and community composition as quantitative traits. Two main patterns emerged. (1) Plant genotype influenced microbial biomass nitrogen in soils under replicated genotypes of Populus angustifolia, F1, and backcross hybrids, but not P. fremontii. Genotype explained up to 78\% of the variation in microbial biomass as indicated by broad-sense heritability estimates (i.e., clonal repeatability). A second estimate of microbial biomass (total phospholipid fatty acid) was more conservative and showed significant genotype effects in P. angustifolia and backcross hybrids. (2) Plant genotype significantly influenced microbial community composition, explaining up to 70\% of the variation in community composition within P. angustifolia genotypes alone. These findings suggest that variation in above- and belowground traits of individual plant genotypes can alter soil microbial dynamics, and suggests that further investigations of the evolutionary implications of genetic feedbacks are warranted.},

In no-choice experiments moths laid most eggs on the stems and lower three leaves of cabbage plants, the lower three leaves of canola plants, but on the upper three leaves of Chinese cabbage plants. The effects of conspecific herbivore damage to foliage could be replicated by mechanical damage. When foliage was damaged, injured cabbage and canola plants were preferred for oviposition over intact conspecifics, whereas injured Chinese cabbage plants were less preferred than intact conspecifics. However, when root tissue was damaged, intact cabbage and canola plants were preferred over injured conspecifics, whereas moths did not discriminate between root-damaged and intact Chinese cabbage plants. Injury to upper leaves significantly affected the intra-plant distribution of eggs. In cabbage and canola plants, injury to leaf 6 significantly increased the number of eggs laid on this leaf, resulting in a significant decrease in the number of eggs laid on the lower foliage/stem of plants, whereas in Chinese cabbage plants it significantly decreased the number of eggs laid on leaf 6. Following oviposition on intact plants, neonate larvae established the vast majority of feeding sites on leaves 5–8 in all three host plants, indicating that larvae moved a considerable distance from preferred oviposition sites in cabbage and canola plants. The growth rate of neonates fed on leaf-6 tissue was significantly greater than that of those fed on leaf-1 tissue; {\textbackslash}textgreater90\% of larvae completed development when fed exclusively on leaf-6 tissue but no larvae completed development when fed exclusively on leaf-1 tissue.

The cause of natural selection and, therefore, of adaptive evolution, is any environmental factor (agent of selection) that results in differential fitness among phenotypes.

Here, I outline three approaches for their investigation: functional analysis, correlational analysis and experimental manipulation. By refocusing attention on the structure and consequences of ecological variation, a better characterisation of selective agents would improve understanding of natural selection and evolution, including adaptive radiation, coevolution, the niche, the evolutionary ecology of the ranges of species and their response to environmental change.},

	abstract = {We investigate the persistence of a population composed of socially interacting individuals living in a lattice structured habitat and the effect of spatially limited social interaction, reproduction, and migration. Both cooperative interaction (enhancing the survivorship of neighboring individuals) and competitive interaction (reducing it) are examined. Mathematical analysis based on pair approximation (or doublet decoupling approximation) and computer simulation are used. Results are: If migration rate is not very large, the population tends to form clusters of individuals (clumped distribution) due to spatially limited reproduction. Although cooperative interaction is more effective in a spatially structured population, the population is more difficult to persist than in the corresponding population without spatial structure, because the shortage of nearest neighbor vacant sites reduces reproduction. Migration of individuals reduces the clumping of the spatial pattern. Pair approximation predicts the equilibrium density fairly accurately when the predicted density is sufficiently high (i.e., more than 40\% sites are occupied). If the predicted density is low however, the pair approximation overestimates the equilibrium population level. To overcome this disagreement, we examined improved pair approximation.},

	abstract = {1. Unreliable pollinator service is thought to promote the evolution of self-compatible plant breeding systems, because selfing may provide reproductive assurance when outcrossing opportunity is limited. The recurrent evolution of self-compatible homostyly from obligately outcrossing heterostylous species has been regarded as a classic example of evolutionary response to lack of pollinators or mates, as homostyly frequently occurs in pollinator-limited or marginal environments. However, male and female sexual organs of homostylous species may display spatial separation (herkogamy), an arrangement presumed to promote outcrossing. It is largely unknown to what extent variation in herkogamy affects opportunities for autonomous selfing and reproductive assurance in self-compatible, homostylous species. 2. Using the homostylous Primula halleri, restricted to alpine environments, we investigated whether herkogamy occurs and varies during anthesis, among individuals, and populations, and compared the effects of herkogamy on seed set among three experimental treatments, to elucidate how herkogamy affects reproductive strategies in a homostylous species. 3. Herkogamy decreases during anthesis, but the ultimate expression of herkogamy in mature flowers differs among individuals and populations. Caging caging experiments indicate that herkogamy reduces a plant's potential for autonomous selfing, and emasculation and open-pollination treatments demonstrate that herkogamy markedly decreases total seed set and the potential for reproductive assurance. 4. Herkogamy early in anthesis may enhance outcrossing potential, while its decrease later could enable reproductive assurance via delayed autonomous selfing in some, but not all plants. Conversely, pronounced herkogamy in older flowers comes at the cost of reduced total reproductive output and imposes pollinator dependence for reproduction, but may promote the genetic diversity of populations. 5. Our study suggests that even small amounts of herkogamy can have large effects on the reproductive strategy of homostylous species, by enabling more outcrossing than generally thought to be typical of homostyly.},

We also examined larval survival, pupal mass, and developmental time to compare larval performance on each plant species. Egg density in the field differed significantly among plant species. However, egg density was not correlated exactly with demonstrated oviposition preference. No larvae could develop on two Salix species. This finding indicated that larval survival is the most critical index of larval performance. Larval performance on each plant species was correlated well with oviposition preference that was revealed by a no-choice experiment in the laboratory. However, this correlation was not found in the field. These results indicate that the preference–performance linkage that was observed under laboratory conditions, was not always maintained in the field.},

	abstract = {With the inflorescence removed, intercalary growth can be maintained in the scape of Gerbera jamesonii by application of gibberellic acid (GA, gibberellin A3) or indole-3-acetic acid (IAA); the latter usually promotes more rapid and greater elongation than the former because of a greater effect on older tissues. Simultaneous application of the two substances, even when both are at optimal levels, promotes more rapid elongation than either substance alone; in fact, the rate of elongation may equal that of the intact scape. In decapitated scapes (receptacle and involueral bracts removed with the inflorescence), GA and IAA promote cell elongation with reduced or no cell division. In deflowered scapes (receptacle and involueral bracts intact) both GA and IAA promote cell division, as well as cell elongation, so that the pattern of scape elongation is nearly the same as that for intact scapes. Apparently the bracts and receptacle contribute something required for cell division which acts in concert with GA and IAA. Deflowered and decapitated scapes elongate at nearly the same rates initially; thus the rate of elongation does not depend on cell division. The ultimate length of the scape is dependent on cell number and, hence, cell division, since deflowered scapes attain greater lengths than those that are decapitated.},

For this purpose we used the ornamental crop Gerbera jamesonii and determined the predator's searching efficiency on three cultivars that differ largely in the density of leaf hairs on the undersurface of the leaves. Walking speed of the mites was highest on the cultivar with the lowest leaf hair density. Walking activity, defined as the percentage of time spent walking, was not dependent on leaf hair density of the cultivars. At both prey densities tested, time until first predation increased with leaf hair density. The predation rate of adult female P. persimilis is affected by trichome density, particularly when prey density is low. At prey densities of 1.3 and 2.5 Tetranychus urticae eggs cm–2, predation rate was inversely related to leaf hair density. At a prey density of 8.0 eggs cm–2 no significant effect of leaf hair density on predation rate was found. These negative effects on searching efficiency and predation success at low prey density of P. persimilis suggest that biological control of T. urticae on gerbera may be hampered by leaf hairs. © Rapid Science Ltd. 1998},

In a greenhouse study, neonate S. exigua placed on the terminal foliage of glanded cotton plants moved down the plant to feed on older leaves. The location of feeding was more concentrated towards the bottom of the plant on previously damaged plants than on undamaged control plants. In contrast, larval feeding on glandless plants was evenly distributed within the plant and no difference in distribution was noted on plants that had sustained previous herbivore injury when compared to undamaged plants. In a laboratory study, where larvae were offered one type of foliage in a no-choice situation, survival on young or mature leaves from glanded or glandless plants, with or without previous herbivore injury, did not differ significantly. However, pupae of larvae reared on young leaves of damaged glanded cotton weighed significantly less than pupae from larvae fed all other diets. Pupae from larvae fed young leaves of control glandless plants weighed significantly more than pupae from all other diets. Similar trends were observed in adult weights. In addition, time to pupation and time to adult emergence were significantly longer for larvae fed young leaves from damaged glanded plants compared to all other diets. The experiments reported here link larval feeding behavior of S. exigua to performance.

Neutral theory has reinvigorated the search by showing that patterns of relative species abundance closely resembling those actually observed arise under the assumption that, to a first approximation, all species are demographically identical on a per capita basis. * 2Here a neutral model is proposed to incorporate all four fundamental processes of population dynamics: birth, death, immigration and emigration. This symmetric model demonstrates that patterns of relative species abundance are fully derivable from these basic processes of population dynamics. * 3The theory derived extends the concept of community by showing that a continuum exists between large-scale (‘metacommunity’) and small-scale (‘local community’) processes, eliminating the artificial distinction between the two made by the current neutral theory and by the theory of island biogeography. * 4The population-based species-abundance model describes very well the observed patterns of relative species abundance of tropical trees, breeding birds in the USA, aphids at Rothamsted, UK, and estuarine fishes in the north-east USA. * 5The study also notes that while species assemblages may be well described by the neutral processes of population dynamics, the inference of mechanisms from pattern fitting is not warranted because one-to-one relationships between generating mechanisms and community patterns usually do not exist, either in the neutral realm or in the niche world.},

This provides proof of principle that allelic variation for root system architecture traits exists, is genetically tractable, and might be exploited for crop breeding. Beyond Arabidopsis, Brachypodium could serve as both a credible and experimentally accessible model for root system architecture variation in monocotyledons, as suggested by first glimpses of the different root morphologies of Brachypodium accessions. Whether a direct knowledge transfer gained from molecular model system studies will work in practice remains unclear however, because of a lack of comprehensive understanding of root system physiology in the native context. For instance, apart from a few notable exceptions, the adaptive value of genetic variation in root system modulators is unknown. Future studies should thus aim at comprehensive characterization of the role of genetic players in root system architecture variation by taking into account the native environmental conditions, in particular soil characteristics.},

Host specificity of Hypocosmia pyrochroma Jones (Lep., Pyralidae), as a potential biological control agent was evaluated on the basis of no-choice and choice larval feeding and survival, and adult oviposition preference tests, involving 38 plant species in 10 families. In no-choice tests, larval feeding and development occurred only on cat's claw creeper. In choice tests, oviposition and larval development was evident only on cat's claw creeper. The results support the host-specificity tests conducted in South Africa, and suggest that H. pyrochroma is a highly specific biological control agent that does not pose any risk to non-target plants tested in Australia.

The results presented here show that plants bearing Mi-1.2 were also resistant to the tomato psyllid, Bactericerca [Paratrioza] cockerelli (Sulc) (Homoptera: Psyllidae), a serious pest of tomato, Solanum lycopersicon (Mill), in the western half of North America. In choice studies, tomato psyllids preferred to settle on plants that did not contain the gene [Moneymaker (mi-1.2)] compared to near-isogenic plants with the gene [Motelle (Mi-1.2)]. As a result, total oviposition was higher on the susceptible variety, although no-choice studies indicated that there were no differences in numbers of eggs laid by individual females on either variety. Survival from egg to adult was higher on plants lacking the gene compared to plants containing the gene. However, there were no differences in total development time of individuals reared from either variety. The results suggest that mechanisms of resistance to the tomato psyllid observed in plants bearing the Mi-1.2 gene are distinct from the mechanisms of resistance to the three phloem feeders examined in other studies.},

	abstract = {* Understanding the effects of intraspecific genetic diversity on the structure and functioning of ecological communities is a fundamentally important part of evolutionary ecology and may also have conservation relevance in identifying the situations in which genetic diversity coincides with species-level diversity. * Early studies within this field documented positive relationships between genetic diversity and ecological structure, but recent studies have challenged these findings. Conceptual synthesis has been hampered because studies have used different measures of intraspecific variation (phenotypically adaptive vs. neutral) and have considered different measures of ecological structure in different ecological and spatial contexts. The aim of this study is to strengthen conceptual understanding by providing an empirical synthesis quantifying the relationship between genetic diversity and ecological structure. * Here, I present a meta-analysis of the relationship between genetic diversity within plant populations and the structure and functioning of associated ecological communities (including 423 effect sizes from 70 studies). I used Bayesian meta-analyses to examine (i) the strength and direction of this relationship, (ii) the extent to which phenotypically adaptive and neutral (molecular) measures of diversity differ in their association with ecological structure and (iii) variation in outcomes among different measures of ecological structure and in different ecological contexts. * Effect sizes measuring the relationship between adaptive diversity (genotypic richness) and both community- and ecosystem-level ecological responses were small, but significantly positive. These associations were supported by genetic effects on species richness and productivity, respectively. * There was no overall association between neutral genetic diversity and measures of ecological structure, but a positive correlation was observed under a limited set of demographic conditions. These results suggest that adaptive and neutral genetic diversity should not be treated as ecologically equivalent measures of intraspecific variation. * Synthesis. This study advances the debate over whether relationships between genetic diversity and ecological structure are either simply positive or negative, by showing how the strength and direction of these relationships changes with different measures of diversity and in different ecological contexts. The results provide a solid foundation for assessing when and where an expanded synthesis between ecology and genetics will be most fruitful.},

We studied phenotypic variation among individuals, fitness differences, and the inheritance of death–feigning behaviour in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). Two–way artificial selections for the duration of death–feigning, over 10 generations, showed a clear direct response in the trait and a correlated response in the frequency of death–feigning, thus indicating variation and inheritance of death–feigning behaviour. A comparison of the two selected strains with divergent frequencies of death–feigning showed a significant difference in the fitness for survival when a model predator, a female Adanson jumper spider, Hasarius adansoni Audouin (Araneomophae: Salticidae), was presented to the beetles. The frequency of predation was lower among beetles from strains selected for long–duration than among those for short–duration death–feigning.

	abstract = {We study a series of spatially implicit lottery models in which two competing plant species, with and without defensive traits, are grazed by a herbivore in a homogeneous habitat. One species (palatable) has no defensive traits, while the other (defended) has defensive traits but suffers reduced reproduction as the result of an assumed trade-off. Not surprisingly, coexistence of these plants cannot occur when the herbivore density is very low (the palatable plant always wins) or very high (the defended plant wins). At intermediate densities, however, herbivory can mediate plant coexistence, even in a homogeneous environment. If the herbivore eats several plants per bite, and its forage-selection depends on the average palatability of the plants it eats, then palatable species in the immediate neighbourhood of defended plants may be more likely to persist (associational resistance) even at higher grazing pressure. If the herbivore shows a positive numerical response to the average palatability of the habitat as a whole, then both plant populations are stabilized and coexistence is promoted, because both species obtain a minority advantage through the negative feedback caused by herbivory. If the herbivore exhibits both of these traits, the system may have at most two non-trivial equilibria, one of which is stable and the other unstable. This means that coexistence in such a system is vulnerable to large fluctuations in herbivore density and identity, and this has implications for conservation in systems where large herbivores are managed to promote plant diversity.},

	abstract = {Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that contribute to the local genetic differentiation of populations is a major goal of evolutionary biology, and debate continues regarding the relative importance of natural selection and random genetic drift to population differentiation. The desert plant Linanthus parryae has played a prominent role in these debates, with nearly six decades of empirical and theoretical work into the causes of spatial differentiation for flower color. Plants produce either blue or white flowers, and local populations often differ greatly in the frequencies of the two color morphs. Sewall Wright first applied his model of "isolation by distance" to investigate spatial patterns of flower color in Linanthus. He concluded that the distribution of flower color morphs was due to random genetic drift, and that Linanthus provided an example of his shifting balance theory of evolution. Our results from comprehensive field studies do not support this view. We studied an area in which flower color changed abruptly from all-blue to all-white across a shallow ravine. Allozyme markers sampled across these regions showed no evidence of spatial differentiation, reciprocal transplant experiments revealed natural selection favoring the resident morph, and soils and the dominant members of the plant community differed between regions. These results support the hypothesis that local differences in flower color are due to natural selection, not due to genetic drift.},

Three species of butterflies of the genus Pieris, P. rapae, P. melete, and P. napi use different sets of cruciferous plants. They prefer different habitats composed of similar sets of cruciferous plants. In our study, P. rapae used temporary habitats with ephemeral plants, P. melete used permanent habitat with persistent plants, although they also used temporary habitats, and P. napi used only permanent habitat. The choice experiment in the field cages indicated that each of the three butterfly species avoided oviposition on plants usually unused in its own habitat, but accepted the unused plants which grew outside its own habitat. Their habitat use and plant use were not explained by intrinsic plant quality examined in terms of larval performance. Pieris larvae collected from persistent plants or more long lasting habitats were more heavily parasitized by two specialist parasitoids, the braconid wasp Cotesia glomerata and the tachinid fly Epicampocera succincta. The results suggest that Pieris habitat and larval food plant use patterns can be explained by two principles. The evolution of habitat preference may have been driven by various factors including escape from parasitism. Once habitat preference has evolved, selection favors the evolution of larval food plant preferences by discriminating against unsuitable plants, including those which are associated with high parasitism pressures.},

	abstract = {BackgroundPhytophagous insects have emerged successfully on the planet also because of the development of diverse and often astonishing defensive strategies against their enemies. The larvae of the mustard leaf beetle Phaedon cochleariae, for example, secrete deterrents from specialized defensive glands on their back. The secretion process involves ATP-binding cassette transporters. Therefore, sugar as one of the major energy sources to fuel the ATP synthesis for the cellular metabolism and transport processes, has to be present in the defensive glands. However, the role of sugar transporters for the production of defensive secretions was not addressed until now.ResultsTo identify sugar transporters in P. cochleariae, a transcript catalogue was created by Illumina sequencing of cDNA libraries. A total of 68,667 transcripts were identified and 68 proteins were annotated as either members of the solute carrier 2 (SLC2) family or trehalose transporters. Phylogenetic analyses revealed an extension of the mammalian GLUT6/8 class in insects as well as one group of transporters exhibiting distinctive conserved motifs only present in the insect order Coleoptera. RNA-seq data of samples derived from the defensive glands revealed six transcripts encoding sugar transporters with more than 3,000 counts. Two of them are exclusively expressed in the glandular tissue. Reduction in secretions production was accomplished by silencing two of four selected transporters. RNA-seq experiments of transporter-silenced larvae showed the down-regulation of the silenced transporter but concurrently the up-regulation of other SLC2 transporters suggesting an adaptive system to maintain sugar homeostasis in the defensive glands.ConclusionWe provide the first comprehensive phylogenetic study of the SLC2 family in a phytophagous beetle species. RNAi and RNA-seq experiments underline the importance of SLC2 transporters in defensive glands to achieve a chemical defense for successful competitive interaction in natural ecosystems.},

Arabidopsis lyrata has emerged as a useful plant for studying ecological and evolutionary genetics, based on its extensive natural variation, sequenced genome and close relationship to A. thaliana. We studied genetic diversity across the entire range of European Arabidopsis lyrata ssp. petraea, in order to explore how population history has influenced population structure. We sampled multiple populations from each region, using nuclear and chloroplast genome markers, and combined population genetic and phylogeographic approaches. Within-population diversity is substantial for nuclear allozyme markers (mean P=0.610, Ae=1.580, He=0.277) and significantly partitioned among populations (FST=0.271). The Northern populations have modestly increased inbreeding (FIS=0.163 verses FIS=0.093), but retain comparable diversity to central European populations. Bottlenecks are common among central and northern Europe populations, indicating recent demographic history as a dominant factor in structuring the European diversity. Although the genetic structure was detected at all geographic scales, two clear differentiated units covering northern and central European areas (FCT =0.155) were identified by Bayesian analysis and supported by regional pairwise FCT calculations. A highly similar geographic pattern was observed from the distribution of chloroplast haplotypes, with the dominant northern haplotypes absent from central Europe. We conclude A. l. petraea's cold-tolerance and preference for disturbed habitats enabled glacial survival between the alpine and Nordic glaciers in central Europe and an additional cryptic refugium. While German populations are probable peri-glacial leftovers, Eastern Austrian populations have diversity patterns possibly compatible with longer-term survival.},

Location Old-growth deciduous forest in the Gault Nature Reserve, Mount St. Hilaire (Quebec, Canada,45′32.957″ N, 73′08.884″ W), with a shorter environmental gradient than normally exists in community studies. Methods We measured 15 functional traits on all tree saplings occurring in 39 (5–7-m radius) sample plots. Using variance decomposition from mixed models and from sums of squares of community-weighted traits, we determined the relative importance of temporal, spatial, inter-specific, intra-specific and intra-individual variation in each trait. In total, we collected trait information on 3317 leaves from 786 twigs sampled on 422 saplings. Results For 12 of 15 traits, over 50\% of the total variance existed between species and inter-specific variation was always the most important source of variation. However for 14 traits, intra-specific and environmental variation represented up to 28\% of the total variation. Variation in community-weighted trait means was mostly generated by changes in species composition, but intra-specific trait variation was the dominate cause for leaf nitrogen, specific leaf area and tree branching. The intra-individual and temporal sources of variation were not important. Conclusions Trait variation should be dominated by inter-specific differences in most studies since they involve systems with more pronounced environmental gradients, higher species richness and more β-diversity than used here.

We endorse the view that diffuse evolution occurs whenever the response to selection by one interacting species on a given trait is altered by the presence of a second interacting species.• Building on the work of others, we clarify and expand the criteria for diffuse evolution and present a simple experimental design that will allow the detection of diffuse selection.• We argue that a greater focus on selection on specific traits and the evolutionary response to that selection will improve our conceptual understanding of how communities affect the evolution of species embedded within them.},

Since the 1960s, prey species with diverse phenotypes have been viewed as the evolved reflection of the perceptual and cognitive characteristics of their predators. Because it is harder to search simultaneously for two or more cryptic prey types than to search for only one, visual predators should tend to focus on the most abundant forms and effectively overlook the others. The result should be frequency-dependent, apostatic selection, which will tend to stabilize the prey polymorphism. Validating this elegant hypothesis has been difficult, and many details have been established only relatively recently. This review clarifies the argument for a perceptual selective mechanism and examines the relevant experimental evidence.},

It is also an organism with a complex life history where larval stages are aquatic and adults are terrestrial. This ontogenetic niche shift could shape the density-dependent regulation of this and other mosquito species, because events that occur during the larval stages impact adult densities. Herein, we present results from simple density-dependent mathematical models fitted using maximum likelihood methods to weekly time series data from Puerto Rico and Thailand. Density-dependent regulation was strong in both populations. Analysis of climatic forcing indicated that populations were more sensitive to climatic variables with low kurtosis, i.e., climatic factors highly variable around the median, rainfall in Puerto Rico, and temperature in Thailand. Changes in environmental variability appear to drive sharp changes in the abundance of mosquitoes. The identification of density-independent (i.e., exogenous) variables forcing sharp changes in disease vector populations using the exogenous factors statistical properties, such as kurtosis, could be useful to assess the impacts of changing climate patterns on the transmission of vector-borne diseases.},

The concentration of Zn in the shoots increased from 300 μg g−1 dry weight in the 1 μM Zn treatment to 32 000 μg g−1 in the 1000 μM Zn treatment. Approximately 60\% of the total Zn in the shoots were water-soluble, and there was no evidence of Zn and P co-precipitation. Both citric and malic acid concentrations in the shoots were not significantly affected by the Zn treatments, whereas in the roots there was a positive response in both organic acids to increasing Zn in solution. Cellular distribution of Zn, Ca and K in frozen hydrated leaf tissues was examined using energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis. Zinc was sequestered in the base of trichomes, whereas the middle and upper parts of trichomes were highly enriched with Ca. Mesophyll cells appeared to have more Zn than the epidermis, probably because the latter were very small in size.

Significant levels of induction were detected for several cultivars of the Old World species Vitis vinifera L. as well as the North American species V. calif arnica Bentham. Phylogenetic relationships among grape genotypes explained little of the variation we observed in induced resistance. Phylogenetic relatedness among grapes did help explain patterns of constitutive resistance for Pacific mites; cultivars of V. vinifera L. tended to be susceptible, whereas North American species were resistant. Wi11amette mites, however, performed well on some Old World cultivars and 2 North American species of Vitis that are native to California. We did not find any strong evidence of a negative correlation between constitutive resistance and strength of induction for these grape genotypes. Our results show that several factors contribute to variation in constitutive and induced resistance in grapes against these 2 species of spider mites, including grape genotype, previous history of mite injury (induction), the species of mite causing previous injury, and to some extent, phylogenetic relatedness among grapes.

The realized climatic niche (climate space) was determined by the intersections of the distribution ranges of the taxa with climate data and is presented in temperature/precipitation diagrams. A positive correlation exists between the climate spaces of the taxa and their range sizes. The diagrams revealed a core climate; that is, a climate space in which all taxa co-exist. This core climate is almost identical to the most parsimonious reconstruction of the genus' ancestral climate space and may be considered an ancestral state of these characters. Mapping the evolutionary changes occurring in the realized climatic space on the phylogenetic tree from the core climate proved to be the most parsimonious procedure. The character complex is homoplastic; that is, many parallel evolutionary events have occurred in the subclades. With the exception of A. thaliana, which is sister to the other species of the genus and occupies a very large climate space, the late-diverged taxa of the other subclades experienced great evolutionary changes whereas the realized climate space of the taxa that diverged earlier resembles the core climate. The latter also show some parallel contractions in the climate space. It is hypothesized that the diversification of Arabidopsis may have started from small to midsized ranges in a temperate climate.},

Based on over 8,000 skins collected from 1995 to 2006, the authors estimated the period during which temperature or precipitation impacted skin abundance and phenology. Adults of C. facialis tended to emerge earlier than those of G. nigrofuscata, for which total skin counts fluctuated up to sevenfold among years. The effective accumulated temperature from the previous 3.0–3.5 mo to the most recent 1.0–1.5 mo at a threshold of approximately {\textbackslash}textgreater18°C showed the best fit to the cumulative skin counts within a season. Temperature explained 47 and 64\% of the total variation in the skin counts for C. facialis and G. nigrofuscata, respectively. The point at which temperature had this effect was consistent between male and female cicadas. Conversely, accumulated precipitation accounted for {\textbackslash}textless16\% of the variation in the skin counts for both species. In summary, this long-term study revealed that late-spring temperature plays a key role in predicting the molting phenology of C. facialis and G. nigrofuscata but does not necessarily explain a large amount of the abundance fluctuation.},

Leaf and inflorescence damage negatively and independently reduced flower, fruit and seed production in the year of damage; leaf damage also reduced rosette size by the end of the first season and flower production in the second year. Leaf damage alone reduced the proportion of flowers forming a fruit and fruit production per plant the second year, but when combined with inflorescence damage no such effect was observed (significant leaf × inflorescence damage interaction). Damage to leaves (sources) caused a greater reduction in future reproduction than did simultaneous damage to leaves and inflorescences (sinks). This demonstrates that a full understanding of the effects of herbivore damage on plant fitness requires that consequences of damage to vegetative and reproductive structures are evaluated over more than 1 year and that non-additive effects are considered.},

	abstract = {Models regarding the evolution of plant resistance to herbivory often assume that the primary mechanism maintaining resistance polymorphisms is the balance between benefits of increased resistance to herbivores and costs associated with the production of a resistance character. However, rarely has it been demonstrated that genetically based resistance traits are costly. Here, we document costs associated with the production of glandular trichomes, a resistance character in Datura wrightii that is predominantly under the control of a single gene of large effect. In the absence of herbivores, plants with glandular trichomes (sticky) produced 45\% fewer viable seeds than plants with nonglandular trichomes (velvety). Although both plant types flowered with similar frequency, sticky plants matured fewer capsules and fewer of their seeds germinated. The fitness difference between the types in herbivore-free conditions was not mitigated by the addition of water, a potentially limiting resource for sticky plants. Under herbivore pressure, there was no significant fitness difference between the types, although the fitness of velvety plants was still higher than that of sticky plants. This occurred even though velvety plants sustained more herbivore damage than sticky plants and were more likely to be attacked by most herbivore species present. The fitness difference between the plant types was especially reduced when herbivore-attacked plants were watered, which indicates that sticky plants may have higher tolerance for damage than velvety plants when supplied with a potentially limiting resource. Yet, the maintenance of a fitness deficit (albeit small and nonsignificant) for sticky plants when attacked by herbivores indicates no net benefit associated with the production of glandular trichomes in this first year of our study. These results add to our current understanding that herbivore resistance characters can be costly and raise the question of how this genetic polymorphism is maintained in wild populations.},

To measure the diet breadth of 4 Phestilla species on Guam, we offered the nudibranchs different corals in choice and no-choice feeding assays. Larval preferences were determined by measuring the percent metamorphosis in response to different coral species. We compared the specificity of larval metamorphosis to adult feeding preferences. Phestilla sibogae ate a range of Porites species (Poritidae) in the field and would not eat other coral genera in the laboratory no-choice assays. Metamorphosis was approximately 90\% in response to 4 Porites spp. Phestilla minor was found on Porites lutea and Porites annae in the field. It preferred P. annae over Porites cylindrica and P. (Synaraea) rus during the choice and no-choice assays. The highest rates of metamorphosis (approx. 80\%) were in response to P. lutea, P. annae, and P. cylindrica. Phestilla sp. 1 is morphologically similar to P. minor, but it eats different Porites species. It preferred P. (S.) rus, but would eat P. cylindrica during the no-choice assays. The highest rate of metamorphosis (approx. 80\%) was in response to P. (S.) rus. Phestilla sp. 2 is distinct from the other Phestilla species studied, as it is a specialist on corals in the genus Goniopora (Poritidae). It preferred G. fruticosa and also ate G. minor and G. lobata during the feeding assays. The highest rates of metamorphosis (approx. 60\%) were in response to G. fruticosa, G. minor, and G. lobata. This study documents a range of diet breadth among Phestilla species. Phestilla spp. larvae could distinguish between coral species within a host genus and showed a tendency to have high metamorphosis on their preferred hosts, but they also metamorphosed in response to non-food coral species.},

	abstract = {abstract: Spatial structuring is important in understanding the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of natural populations since local demes are rarely, if ever, completely isolated from neighboring demes. Plant host‐pathogen interactions provide good examples of coevolutionary systems where both numerical and genetic dynamics have been explicitly investigated in a spatial context and where genes under selection can be unambiguously identified. In this article, we focus on long‐term studies of several natural host‐pathogen interactions that span a range of life histories and taxa. We use these studies to evaluate some predictions for numerical and genetic patterns at local and regional scales. Specifically, we examine the degree of among‐population asynchrony in disease presence/absence and abundance, and the extent to which this is a function of isolation. For one host‐pathogen interaction (Linum‐Melampsora), we focus on whether there is local correspondence between resistance and virulence genes (as would be predicted by single‐population coevolutionary models) or whether such correspondence occurs at larger spatial scales. Finally, we discuss the implications of these studies with respect to the impact of host and pathogen life‐history variation on the spatial scale of coevolutionary interactions. Understanding coevolutionary interactions in nature requires a multidisciplinary approach, including long‐term empirical studies of multiple populations and computer modeling.},

	abstract = {The strength of plant-herbivore interactions varies spatially and through plant ontogeny, which may result in variable selection on plant defense, both among populations and life-history stages. To test whether populations have diverged in herbivore resistance at an early plant stage, we quantified oviposition preference and larval feeding by Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) on young (5–6 weeks old) Arabidopsis lyrata (L.) O'Kane \& Al-Shehbaz (Brassicaceae) plants, originating from 12 natural populations, six from Sweden and six from Norway. Arabidopsis lyrata can be trichome-producing or glabrous, with glabrous plants usually receiving more damage from insect herbivores in natural populations. We used the six populations polymorphic for trichome production to test whether resistance against P. xylostella differs between the glabrous and the trichome-producing morph among young plants. There was considerable variation among populations in the number of eggs received and the proportion of leaf area consumed by P. xylostella, but not between regions (Sweden vs. Norway) or trichome morphs. Rosette size explained a significant portion of the variation in oviposition and larval feeding. The results demonstrate that among-population variation in resistance to insect herbivory can be detected among very young individuals of the perennial herb A. lyrata. They further suggest that trichome densities are too low at this plant developmental stage to contribute to resistance, and that the observed among-population variation in resistance is related to differences in other plant traits.},

	abstract = {Published anecdotal reports suggest that Japanese beetles, Popillia japonica Newman, feed more heavily on host plants growing in full sun than on shaded plants. We studied the effects of shading on foliar characteristics of roses (Rosa variety floribunda `Class Act') and determined preference and fecundity of beetles provided with sun- or shade-conditioned leaves. Defoliation by P. japonica also was compared between sun-grown and experimentally shaded roses in the field. Leaves from plants grown in full sun were smaller and thicker than ones from shaded plants, with slightly higher tannins. Leaf toughness and nitrogen levels were not affected by shading, but leaves from sun-grown plants had relatively higher sugar content. Beetles consistently consumed more foliage from sun-grown plants than from shade-grown plants in laboratory preference tests. However, beetles fed continuously for 2 wk on leaves from sun- or shade-grown plants had similar fecundity. In the field, beetles fed somewhat more heavily on foliage of roses grown in full sun than on plants grown under cloth canopies that provided 73\% shading. Plants grown under semitransparent canopies of spun-bonded fabric sustained intermediate damage, suggesting that one way that shading may reduce defoliation is by rendering the shaded plants less apparent or accessible to host-seeking beetles. Implications of this work for understanding feeding behavior of P. japonica, and for pest management through planting site selection, are discussed.},

We tested whether possums altered their feeding behavior in response to increasing levels of cineole, a dietary terpene. Possums were fed artificial diets containing three levels of cineole; zero (basal diet), medium (6.8\% of total dry matter, DM), and high (15.3\% DM). In another experiment, we introduced gallic acid, a dietary phenolic, into the diets. Possums were offered a Choice PSM diet (cineole and gallic acid diets simultaneously) or a No-Choice PSM diet (containing either cineole or gallic acid). Detoxification products of cineole and gallic acid were examined in urine to determine that different detoxification pathways were utilized in the elimination of each compound. With increasing cineole levels, possums ate less, had smaller feeding bouts, and had a lower rate of intake, but did not extend their total nightly feeding time. Possums offered the Choice PSM diet, compared with the No-Choice diets, ate more, had larger feeding bouts, and tended to increase their rate of intake. Results from the urinary analysis indicated that gallic acid and cineole were not involved in competing detoxification pathways in brushtail possums. There was also a significant sex effect: females ate more overall, ate more per feeding bout, and ate at a higher rate than males. These results indicate that PSMs not only constrain overall intake, but that possums alter their feeding behavior in response to them. Altered feeding patterns may reduce the negative influence of PSMs on intake.},

Different objects are offered in a walking arena and the behaviour of beetles is observed. Beetles orient toward vertically or horizontally striped black and white pattern independent of stripe orientation. The results suggest that contrast facilitates orientation in the field, whereas the pattern itself may be less important for host location in dense vegetation. The response to green and yellow objects is tested to investigate discrimination abilities between young (green) and mature (yellow) leaves. Beetles prefer green over yellow independent of material (cardboard or leaves of Nasturtium officinale R. Br., Brassicaceae). Preference behaviour tested in a dual-choice contact assay coincides with visual preferences, where adults prefer young, more nutritious leaves for feeding and oviposition. Furthermore, females discriminate between visual cues of green leaves and green cardboard, whereas males do not, indicating that females are more sensitive in colour discrimination. Differences in colour wavelength influence the choice of beetle behaviour more strongly than differences in intensity. Both sexes of P. cochleariae prefer volatiles of the host plant N. officinale, whereas only females respond to the main volatile compound 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate. Given a choice between visual and olfactory cues, males orientate towards the colour cues, whereas females do not show any preferences. In males, visual cues may thus override olfactory cues, whereas, in females, both are equally important, which may reflect different ecological requirements and/or physiological abilities.},

I studied induced responses in annual wild radish plants, Raphanus raphanistrum and R. sativus (Brassicaceae), which included increased density and total number of setose trichomes on newly formed leaves of previously damaged plants compared to undamaged controls. I also characterized the effects of induced responses on the preference and performance of several herbivores and the net consequences for plant performance in the field. Wild radish plants damaged by caterpillars or sprayed with a natural plant response elicitor, jasmonic acid, supported reduced growth of generalist noctuid larvae compared to unmanipulated control plants. Induced responses did not affect the growth of specialist Pieris rapae larvae. In choice and no-choice experiments, induction reduced the feeding by noctuid larvae but did not reduce gross growth efficiency, an indicator of insect growth per unit of plant material consumed. Finally, colonization of plants by leafminers was lower on plants that received previous damage, compared to controls. In field experiments conducted over 2 yr, herbivory by naturally occurring grasshoppers was lower on induced plants than on both unmanipulated controls and leaf damage controls (plants with leaf area removed without the associated induced response). Plant fitness, as estimated by fruit and seed production, was enhanced for induced plants compared to controls. These results demonstrate that induced responses to herbivory can reduce the preference and performance of a variety of herbivores and ultimately increase plant fitness in natural environments. In order for a plant trait to be characterized as a defense, it must increase plant fitness in environments with herbivory. Although much attention has been given to detecting costs of plant defenses, this is one of the first systems for which fitness benefits of induced resistance have been demonstrated.},

Morphological divergence between regions was high despite low differentiation in selectively neutral genetic markers, whereas populations within regions showed very little neutral divergence and trait differentiation. QST {\textbackslash}textgreater FST was robust against altering assumptions about the additive genetic proportions of variance components. The homogenizing effect of gene flow (or a short time available for neutral divergence) has apparently been effectively counterbalanced by differential natural selection, although one trait showed some evidence of being under uniform stabilizing selection. Neutral markers can hence be misleading for identifying evolutionary significant units, and adopting the PST–FST approach might therefore be valuable when common garden experiments is not an option. We discuss the statistical difficulties of documenting uniform selection as opposed to divergent selection, and the need for estimating measurement error. Instead of only comparing overall QST and FST values, we advocate the use of partial matrix permutation tests to analyse pairwise QST differences among populations, while statistically controlling for neutral differentiation.},

Our survey reveals that several mechanisms, some operating between populations and others within them, can contribute to both color polymorphism persistence and speciation. As expected, divergent selection clearly can couple with gene flow to maintain color polymorphism and mediate speciation. More surprisingly, recent evidence suggests that diverse forms of within-population sexual selection can generate negative frequency dependence and initiate reproductive isolation. These findings deserve additional study, particularly concerning the roles of heterogeneous visual environments and correlational selection.

	abstract = {A basic idea of plant defences is that a plant should gain protection from its own defence. In addition, there is evidence that defence traits of the neighbouring plants can influence the degree of protection of an individual plant. These associational effects depend in part on the spatial scale of herbivore selectivity. A strong between-patch selectivity together with a weak within-patch selectivity leads to a situation where a palatable plant could avoid being grazed by growing in a patch with unpalatable plants, which is referred to as associational defence. Quite different associational effects will come about if the herbivore instead is unselective between patches and selective within a patch. We studied these effects in a manipulative experiment where we followed the food choice of fallow deer when they encountered two patches of overall different quality. One of the two patches consisted of pellets with low-tannin concentration in seven out of eight buckets and with high concentration in the remaining bucket. The other patch instead had seven high- and one low-tannin bucket. We performed the experiment both with individuals one at a time and with a group of 16–17 deer. We found that the deer were unselective between patches, but selective within a patch, and that the single low-tannin bucket among seven high-tannin buckets was used more than a low-tannin bucket among other low-tannin buckets. This corresponds to a situation where a palatable plant that grows among unpalatable plants is attacked more than if it was growing among its own kind, and for this effect we suggest the term neighbour contrast susceptibility, which is the opposite of associational defence. We also found that the high-tannin bucket in the less defended patch was less used than the high-tannin buckets in the other patch, which corresponds to neighbour contrast defence. The neighbour contrast susceptibility was present both for individual and group foraging, but the strength of the effect was somewhat weaker for groups due to weaker within-patch selectivity.},

Whereas beech is the only host plant for R. fagi, the polyphagous defoliator L. dispar can switch to a wide range of plant species in case a resource is exhausted or less suited. In the present study we address the issue whether or not the induced response of beech leaves caused by R. fagi will decrease their nutritional quality for gypsy moth larvae. R. fagi adults perform typical feeding holes of about 2-3 mm in diameter at two terms in the season: (1) after hibernation and prior to oviposition in early spring and (2) as new generation weevils at the end of May. Larvae mine the leaves starting with a gallery close to a leaf nerve. The mine is enlarged when it reaches the leaf edge where pupation occurs. The intact part of the leaf remains turgescent and vital. The wide range of host plants of gypsy moth includes Fagus sylvatica, too. R. fagi-mined leaves of beech were fed to larvae of L. dispar in two experiments. (1) L4-larvae of L. dispar forced to feed R. fagi-mined leaves in no-choice experiments showed a reduced weight gain compared to conspecifics on control leaves. (2) In choice experiments gypsy moth larvae of the same stage preferred control (non-mined) leaves over R. fagi-mined leaves. The results are discussed as a strategy of specialists to protect its ecological niche against a generalist mediated by the induced response elicited by the specialist.},

	abstract = {Allocation to reproduction is often examined at the whole plant level from an allometric perspective; however, investment in reproduction is a hierarchical process which represents the integration of adjustments at different hierarchical levels. This essay review presents some key issues in reproductive allocation by examining problems of allocation at different hierarchical levels within plant. At the whole plant level, the application of ‘Rensch's rule’ to plants is discussed as a mechanism that might explain size differences in relation to gender in dioecious species. At branch level, the existence of vegetative branches may be explained by hypotheses on branch specialization and costs of reproduction. However, vegetative branches might also constitute an ‘assurance’ for reproduction in variable environments. At a lower hierarchical level, fruit abortion is a process widely observed in plants that impose limits to our capacity to estimate and develop general laws about reproductive allocation in plants. The question of whether fruit abortion can be used by the parent to produce a more homogeneous progeny that limits asymmetric competition among sibs is discussed. Finally, it seems that in some cases the allocation within seeds is in accordance with some predictions of kin selection theory. Most of these topics contain open questions that deserve further research.},

The growth rate and recruitment rate are proportional to the fraction of free space within the local habitat. * 4In many corals, including A. hyacinthus, recruitment occurs in a short period once a year. However, our model illustrates that the colony size distribution does not show distinguishable cohorts since the observed variance in growth rate is large. The model with discrete settlement and a large variance in growth rate results in size distributions that are very well approximated by an explicitly soluble model with constant recruitment and no growth variance. * 5When mortality is low, the dynamics of size distribution show two different phases in the recovery process. In the first phase, size distribution is determined by recruitment and growth, and can be predicted well by the case without mortality. After free space is depleted, recruitment and growth slow down and become balanced with mortality. The equilibrium size distribution is controlled by all the three processes. Both for the transient and the equilibrium size distribution, the average colony size increases with growth rate but decreases with recruitment rate. * 6Strongly skewed colony-size distributions in which small size classes have the largest numbers are generated for a wide range of parameters by the space-limitation in growth, even without partial death of colonies.},

	abstract = {The amount and genetic composition of pollen grains that are transported to flowers influence the reproduction and fitness of plants. Despite the importance of insect-pollination systems, an understanding of those systems is still lacking due to the absence of a genetic analysis of pollen grains that are transported to flowers. We evaluated the pollination efficiencies of bumblebees (Apidae, Bombus spp.), flower beetles (Scarabaeidae, subfamily Cetoniinae, Protaetia and Eucetonia sp.), and small beetles (Lagriidae, Arthromacra sp.) that visited the flowers of Magnolia obovata (Magnoliaceae) using quantitative (flower visitation frequency, amount of adherent pollen per insect) and qualitative (origin and genetic diversity of adherent pollen per insect) criteria. Most of the pollen adhering to bumblebees and small beetles was self-pollen. This result suggests that visitation by these insects may cause geitonogamous pollen flow and negatively affect the reproduction of M. obovata, causing inbreeding depression. In contrast, flower beetles transported large amounts of genetically diverse outcross pollen. Our results suggest that certain beetle species contribute quantitatively and qualitatively to the pollination of M. obovata. Direct genetic analysis of pollen grains will advance our understanding of plant mating systems and may shed light on the mutualism and coevolution of plants and flower visitors.},

	abstract = {▪ Abstract Population and community ecology need a large-scale perspective because local patterns (of biodiversity) and processes (trophic interactions) are influenced by the regional setting. The ratio of the foraging range and/or dispersal ability to the distance between landscape elements influences local population dynamics. The spatial scale experienced by a species may be linked to its trophic level and also to traits such as body size, resource specialization, rarity, and population size variability. Hence, communities are assemblages of species with different spatial strategies. Effects of habitat loss and habitat fragmentation on plant-herbivore, herbivore-enemy, as well as plant-pollinator interactions are contingent on species and landscape. Metapopulation theory provides a unifying frame to approach plant-insect systems across fragmented landscape, although the landscape context is often ignored. In some cases theory is far ahead of empirical research. We call for more population data on large spatial and temporal scales to better understand plant-insect populations across fragmented landscapes.},

A population that had been reared for several generations on Brassica rapa was split and transferred to either one of the alternative Brassicaceae species, Sinapis alba and Nasturtium officinale, or was kept on B. rapa for continuous rearing. After 10 generations, a subset of the Sinapis and Nasturtium populations was tested again on the original host species, B. rapa. Larval performance and adult preferences were tested.3. In the second generation, beetles performed better (higher body mass and faster larval development) on B. rapa than on the two alternative species. No evidence for imprinting was found. After 10 generations of selection on the alternative plant species, the performance of the beetles on these species improved. This effect was more pronounced on S. alba than on N. officinale. However, the performance on B. rapa after 10 generations of selection on the alternative species was unaffected, and was nearly equal to the insects kept continuously on B. rapa, with slight deviations only in the lines selected on N. officinale.4. Most females preferred to oviposit on B. rapa independent of their experience, suggesting a genetic fixation and/or a positive relationship between larval performance and adult preference. Preferences may have been also driven by physical leaf characteristics.},

Dissecting the genetic basis of such traits is crucial for the improvement of crops and management of diseases. Here, we develop a new resource to identify genes underlying such quantitative traits in Arabidopsis thaliana, a genetic model organism in plants. We show that using a large population of inbred lines derived from intercrossing 19 parents, we can localize the genes underlying quantitative traits better than with existing methods. Using these lines, we were able to replicate the identification of previously known genes that affect developmental traits in A. thaliana and identify some new ones. This paper also presents all the necessary biological and computational material necessary for the scientific community to use these lines in their own research. Our results suggest that the use of lines derived from a multiparent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC lines) should be very useful in other organisms.},

For most lepidopteran species, this is particularly important as the hatching neonate larvae of many species are relatively immobile. Thus, the site of oviposition chosen by a female adult can greatly influence the probability of survival for her offspring. In the present study, we investigated the oviposition preference of adult Trichoplusia ni moths for six plant species to determine whether they could accurately rank the suitability of the plants for larval development. We also compared oviposition preferences to neonate larval acceptance and preference to determine whether the adult host range matched that of larval diet breath. Our results indicate that in two-choice and no-choice tests adult T. ni were able to rank the plants accurately, with the exception of anise hyssop. However, when given a choice of all six plants together, they laid more eggs on a plant that was not suitable for larval survival. Larvae accepted and fed on all plants in no-choice tests, and accurately ranked them according to larval performance. We conclude that neonate larvae are better able than adults to rank plants according to larval performance, and that larval diet breadth is wider than the range of plants accepted by adults. We also provide a discussion of the reduced accuracy of adult oviposition preference with increased plant choices.},

Mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) was used to investigate the genetic architecture of zinc tolerance in this species. A first-generation backcross progeny of A. halleri ssp. halleri from a highly contaminated industrial site and its nontolerant relative A. lyrata ssp. petraea was produced and used for QTL mapping of zinc tolerance. A genetic map covering most of the A. halleri genome was constructed using 85 markers. Among these markers, 65 were anchored in A. thaliana and revealed high synteny with other Arabidopsis genomes. Three QTL of comparable magnitude on three different linkage groups were identified. At all QTL positions zinc tolerance was enhanced by A. halleri alleles, indicating directional selection for higher zinc tolerance in this species. The two-LOD support intervals associated with these QTL cover 24, 4, and 13 cM. The importance of each of these three regions is emphasized by their colocalization with HMA4, MTP1-A, and MTP1-B, respectively, three genes well known to be involved in metal homeostasis and tolerance in plants.},

By over-expressing the apple MYB transcription factor, MYB10, we have generated apple trees, Malus × domestica Borkh.

In this study, we investigated the impact of the high anthocyanic apple leaves on the behaviour, feeding, and life cycle parameters of the light brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), a widespread herbivorous pest of apples. Behaviour of 1- to 3-day-old larvae towards red anthocyanin-rich and green apple leaves was studied in choice and no-choice trials, and survival, growth, and development of larvae feeding on red and green apple leaves from the neonate to pupation were compared. First-instar E. postvittana showed a statistically significant preference for green over red leaves from three transgenic red apple lines and a preference for the less red old leaves over the bright red new leaves. This was significantly different from their behaviour towards wild type green leaves, where new leaves were selected over old. In complete darkness, first-instar E. postvittana showed no significant preference for the green leaves, indicating that visual cues were important. Although larval survival was not greatly affected by feeding on the red foliage, larval growth and development were significantly affected by feeding on leaves from some of the transgenic red apple lines. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of leaf phenolics showed that both anthocyanins and quercetin glycosides were significantly raised in the red transgenic lines compared with wild types.},

Interactions among plants and their consumers, pollinators and dispersers are central to evolutionary theory, but interactions among plants themselves have received much less attention. Thus focusing more attention on the evolutionary role of plant–plant interactions may provide greater insight into the processes that organize communities. 2. Here, we integrate divergent themes in the literature in an effort to provide a synthesis of empirical evidence and ideas about how plant interactions may affect evolution and how evolution may affect plant interactions. 3. First, we discuss the idea of niche partitioning evolving through competitive interactions among plants, the idea of niche construction evolving through facilitative interactions, and the connections between these ideas and more recent research on diversity and ecosystem function and trait-based community organization. 4. We then review how a history of coexistence within a region might affect competitive outcomes and explore the mechanisms by which plants exert selective forces on each other. Next, we consider recent research on invasions suggesting that plant interactions can reflect regional evolutionary trajectories. Finally, we place these lines of research into the context of extended phenotypes and the geographic mosaic of co-evolution. 5. Synthesis. Our synthesis of separate lines of inquiry is a step towards understanding the evolutionary importance of interactions among plants, and suggests that the evolutionary consequences of interactions contribute to communities that are more than assemblages of independent populations.},

	abstract = {Phloem feeding involves unique biological interactions between the herbivore and its host plant. The economic importance of aphids, whiteflies, and other phloem-feeding insects as pests has prompted research to isolate sources of resistance to piercing-sucking insects in crops. However, little information exists about the molecular nature of plant sensitivity to phloem feeding. Recent discoveries involving elicitation by plant pathogens and chewing insects and limited studies on phloem feeders suggest that aphids are capable of inducing responses in plants broadly similar to those associated with pathogen infection and wounding. Our past work showed that compatible aphid feeding on leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana induces localized changes in levels of transcripts of genes that are also associated with infection, mechanical damage, chewing herbivory, or resource allocation shifts. We used microarray and macroarray gene expression analyses of infested plants to better define the response profile of A. thaliana to M. persicae feeding. The results suggest that genes involved in oxidative stress, calcium-dependent signaling, pathogenesis-related responses, and signaling are key components of this profile in plants infested for 72 or 96 h. The use of plant resistance to aphids in crops will benefit from a better understanding of induced responses. The establishment of links between insect elicitation, plant signaling associated with phloem feeding, and proximal resistance mechanisms is critical to further research progress in this area. Arch.

	abstract = {Games between trees are studied to explain the height and the crown shape in a community. It is assumed that each tree maximizes the net productivity under the light environment, which is determined by surrounding trees. In both models, the asymmetry of competition is important, because higher leaves shade lower leaves but the lower don't shade the higher. In the tree-height game, each tree is assumed to choose a height given its crown shape. The height at a monomorphic equilibrium, in which all the trees of a community have the same height, increases with the tree density and the amount of leaves per tree, but decreases with the cost coefficient and the crown thickness. When the crown is thin enough, a polymorphic equilibrium appears, in which a community includes trees of different heights but with the same fitness. In the crown-shape game, each tree is assumed to choose the distribution of foliage along the height axis. A lone tree should have a hemispherical crown as the optimum. The monomorphic equilibrium in which all the trees in a community have the same crown shape is calculated. As the tree density increases, the average height of a crown of each tree increases and the height on the tree with the maximum foliage increases, but each tree should have some foliage all the way down to the ground. Several reasons for foliage cutoff at the lowest layer are discussed.},

After controlling for sampling effects, β-diversity of woody plants was similar and higher than expected by chance in both forests, reflecting strong intraspecific aggregation. However, different mechanisms appeared to explain aggregation in the two forests. In the temperate forest, aggregation reflected stronger environmental correlations, suggesting an important role for species-sorting (e.g. environmental filtering) processes, whereas in the tropics, aggregation reflected stronger spatial correlations, more likely reflecting dispersal limitation. We suggest that biogeographical differences in the relative importance of different community assembly mechanisms contribute to these striking gradients in global biodiversity.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of gene flow estimates is unknown in most natural populations because direct estimates of dispersal are often not possible. These estimates can be highly imprecise or even biased because population genetic structure reflects more than a simple balance between genetic drift and gene flow. Most of the models used to estimate gene flow also assume very simple patterns of movement. As a result, multiple interpretations of population structure involving contemporary gene flow, departures from equilibrium, and other factors are almost always possible. One way to isolate the relative contribution of gene flow to population genetic differentiation is to utilize comparative methods. Population genetic statistics such as FST, heterozygosity and Nei's D can be compared between species with differing dispersal abilities if these species are otherwise phylogenetically, geographically and demographically comparable. Accordingly, the available literature was searched for all groups that meet these criteria to determine whether broad conclusions regarding the relationships between dispersal, population genetic structure, and gene flow estimates are possible. Allozyme and mtDNA data were summarized for 27 animal groups in which dispersal differences can be characterized. In total, genetic data were obtained for 333 species of vertebrates and invertebrates from terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats. Across these groups, dispersal ability was consistently related to population structure, with a mean rank correlation of -0.72 between ranked dispersal ability and FST. Gene flow estimates derived from private alleles were also correlated with dispersal ability, but were less widely available. Direct-count heterozygosity and average values of Nei's D showed moderate degrees of correlation with dispersal ability. Thus, despite regional, taxonomic and methodological differences among the groups of species surveyed, available data demonstrate that dispersal makes a measurable contribution to population genetic differentiation in the majority of animal species in nature, and that gene flow estimates are rarely so overwhelmed by population history, departures from equilibrium, or other microevolutionary forces as to be uninformative.},

	abstract = {The evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis (EICA) predicts that when alien plants are free from their natural enemies they evolve lower allocation to defense in order to achieve a higher growth rate. If this hypothesis is true, the converse implication would be that the defense against herbivory could be restored if a natural enemy also becomes present in the introduced range. We tested this scenario in the case of Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed) – a species that invaded Japan from North America. We collected seeds from five North American populations, three populations in enemy free areas of Japan and four populations in Japan where the specialist herbivore Ophraella communa naturalized recently. Using plants grown in a common garden in Japan, we compared performance of O. communa with a bioassay experiment. Consistent with the EICA hypothesis, invasive Japanese populations of A. artemisiifolia exhibited a weakened defense against the specialist herbivores and higher growth rate than native populations. Conversely, in locations where the herbivore O. communa appeared during the past decade, populations of A. artemisiifolia exhibited stronger defensive capabilities. These results strengthen the case for EICA and suggest that defense levels of alien populations can be recuperated rapidly after the native specialist becomes present in the introduced range. Our study implies that the plant defense is evolutionary labile depending on plant-herbivore interactions.},

Additionally, males with well-developed weapons typically differ behaviourally and morphologically from weaponless males. However, the genetic basis to these phenotypic correlations has not been investigated. The broad-horned flour beetle, Gnatocerus cornutus, is a species in which males engage in fights using their enlarged mandibles. We conducted bidirectional selection on beetle mandible length to investigate the correlated responses in male behaviour and body shape. Mandible size diverged significantly after 10 generations of selection. We also found that the microevolutionary enlargement of mandibles affected male morphology and behaviour. Compensatory or supportive traits of the mandibles (head, prothorax, genae and forelegs) also became enlarged, but eye area, antenna, head horn and elytra length were all reduced. These correlated responses in morphology may be the result of developmental integration of these traits and mandibles, but the reduction in size of some traits could also be caused by trade-offs generated by resource competition between characters. In any case, the enlargement of the weapon (mandibles) altered male body shape into a suitable form for fighting. Fighting endurance also evolved as a correlated response to selection on mandible size, with lines selected for larger mandibles able to fight for longer. It therefore appears that morphology and fighting are genetically correlated with each other.},

Little is currently known about the extent of genome size variation within taxa and the evolutionary forces acting on this variation.

The aim of this study was to determine the genome size of A. kamchatica, whether there is variation in ploidy and/or genome size in A. kamchatica and to study how genome size has evolved. We used propidium iodide flow cytometry to measure 2C DNA content of 73 plants from 25 geographically diverse populations of the putative allotetraploid A. kamchatica and its parents, Arabidopsis lyrata and Arabidopsis halleri. All A. kamchatica plants appear to be tetraploids. The mean 2C DNA content of A. kamchatica was 1.034 pg (1011 Mbp), which is slightly smaller than the sum of its diploid parents (A. lyrata: 0.502 pg; A. halleri: 0.571 pg). Arabidopsis kamchatica appears to have lost ∼37.594 Mbp (3.6 \%) of DNA from its 2C genome. Tetraploid A. lyrata from Germany and Austria appears to have lost ∼70.366 Mbp (7.2 \%) of DNA from the 2C genome, possibly due to hybridization with A. arenosa, which has a smaller genome than A. lyrata. We did find genome size differences among A. kamchatica populations, which varied up to 7 \%. Arabidopsis kamchatica ssp. kawasakiana from Japan appears to have a slightly larger genome than A. kamchatica ssp. kamchatica from North America, perhaps due to multiple allopolyploid origins or hybridization with A. halleri. However, the among-population coefficient of variation in 2C DNA content is lower in A. kamchatica than in other Arabidopsis taxa. Due to its close relationship to A. thaliana, A. kamchatica has the potential to be very useful in the study of polyploidy and genome evolution.},

	abstract = {Exotic plant species can affect native plant species both directly via competition and indirectly by modifying native species' interactions with other organisms in the community. Both direct and indirect effects can have strong fitness impacts on the native species and can result in cascading effects throughout the invaded community. Many exotic plant species escape from the herbivores with which they co-evolved, but in our study system, the exotic Egyptian alfalfa weevil (Hypera brunneipennis) has been introduced to California and is able to feed both on the exotic plant Medicago polymorpha and on the California native Lotus wrangelianus. Because these two plant species share this common herbivore, the possibility of strong herbivore-mediated indirect interactions between these introduced and native plant species is plausible. We used observational studies and manipulative field experiments to determine whether exotic Medicago affects herbivory on the native Lotus and whether Medicago reduces the fitness of Lotus through direct competitive effects and/or herbivore-mediated indirect effects. Both observational and experimental data indicate that Medicago increases weevil herbivory on the native Lotus. Additionally, Medicago reduced Lotus fitness through direct as well as indirect mechanisms. In 2002, Medicago reduced Lotus fitness even when herbivores were experimentally reduced, suggesting direct competitive effects of Medicago on the native Lotus. In contrast, in 2003, Medicago reduced Lotus fitness only in the presence of herbivores, indicating that the fitness effects in that year were largely indirect and mediated by herbivores. Our results demonstrate that the net fitness consequences of indirect and direct effects of exotic plant species on native plants can vary temporally, depending on the abundance of members of the herbivore community. Also, rather than limiting the success of exotics, introduced herbivores that feed on exotic plants may provide additional, indirect avenues through which exotic plants can reduce the fitness of native species.},

	abstract = {In a game theory context, we investigated conditions for an evolutionarily stable equilibrium of defended, signalling plants, and plants mimicking these signals – that is, conditions for a stable mimicry complex. We modelled this in three steps. First, we analysed conditions for selection for defended, signalling plants, in a population of undefended plants. Second, we analysed conditions for when mimicking plants can invade a population of defended, signalling plants, leading to a stable equilibrium between the two strategies. Third, we analysed how sampling of signalling plants by herbivores affects the equilibrium between the strategies. The predictions show that mimicry of plant defence signals may be common, and even imperfect mimics could invade a population of defended, signalling plants. Whether the latter prediction holds or not depends on how herbivores generalize over signals, and on the length of their ’avoidance sequence'. The length of the avoidance sequence is the number of signalling plants that a herbivore avoids to attack, after attacking a defended plant. If herbivores always sample signalling plants, then mimicry cannot evolve, whereas if herbivores have a long avoidance sequence, this may allow selection even for imperfect mimics.},

Estimates of the parameters can be obtained by means of iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS). When the events of interest follow the Poisson distribution, the IRLS algorithm is equivalent to using the method of scoring to obtain maximum likelihood (ML) estimates. The general Poisson regression models include log-linear, quasilinear and intrinsically nonlinear models. The approach considered enables one to concentrate on describing the relation between the dependent variable and the predictor variables through the regression model. Standard statistical packages that support IRLS can then be used to obtain ML estimates, their asymptotic covariance matrix, and diagnostic measures that can be used to aid the analyst in detecting outlying responses and extreme points in the model space. Applications of these methods to epidemiologic follow-up studies with the data organized into a life-table type of format are discussed. The method is illustrated by using a nonlinear model, derived from the multistage theory of carcinogenesis, to analyze lung cancer death rates among British physicians who were regular cigarette smokers.},

	abstract = {The reproductive success of periodical cicadas, measured as the number of offspring produced per adult, is found to increase as adult density increases. The inverse density-dependent pattern at the adult stage occurred over the entire range of adult densities encountered. This result could have been caused by (1) predator satiation, (2) increased fecundity at higher densities, (3) more efficient mating at higher densities, and (4) movement of adults from sites of low initial densities to sites of high densities. The hypothesis of predator satiation was explored in depth. Predation at each site was crudely estimated by collecting cicada wings, which are discarded by avian predators. If predator satiation accounts for the inverse density-dependent mortality, then each cicada's risk of capture will decrease as cicada density increases. The data suggest that this prediction is true; predation did not increase as cicada density increased so that the probability of escaping predation is greater at high-density sites. Estimated predator densities are independent of cicada densities, which indicates that predators cannot respond numerically to the cicada emergence. As cicada density increases, the number of cicada wings recovered per bird does not significantly increase, suggesting that birds are satiated. Significantly more cicada wings were recovered at sites with more birds. Total cicada predation was independent of cicada density but dependent on the density of predators. Some evolutionary consequences of these results are discussed.},

Generally there is a range of intermediate values of gene flow over which local polymorphism will occur. The length and location of the range depends, for the most part, upon the magnitude of the local selection pressures and upon the net effect of the overall average, or global, selection regime. For the cases studied, variables are introduced to characterize the magnitudes of the local and global selection pressures. The variable Z measures the net effect of the global regime near equilibrium relative to the square of the local selection pressures. In general, the range over which local polymorphism occurs will be long when the condition Z ≃ 1 is met. Within limits, asymmetry, in terms of the proportions of different local selection regimes within a mosaic environment, increases the range. Increased environmental complexity, in terms of the number of different kinds of local selection regimes, has a similar, but smaller, effect. Extension of these results to studies that used different analytic models of gene flow is discussed. Inferences are drawn concerning the evolutionary significance of gene flow.},

When herbivores were present, however, palatable species appeared to depend completely on unpalatable competitors to provide microsites of reduced herbivory to prevent grazers from causing local extinction of the preferred species. For the species studied here, the cost of being associated with a larger, unpalatable competitor was much less than the cost of increased consumption in the absence of that competitor. Under these conditions, one competitor can have a strong positive effect on another. Associational defenses can provide an unappreciated mechanism for maintaining species richness within communities that are dominated by one or a few major species. In this community, increases in the abundance of common late-successional competitors led to increases, not decreases, in the abundance and number of other species and to retention, not exclusion, of early-successional species.},

We conducted a meta‐analysis of 29 published studies of 16 different plant species reporting a total of 467 genetic correlations between resistances to multiple herbivores or pathogens. In general, genetic associations between resistances to multiple natural enemies tended to be positive regardless of the breeding design, type of attacker, and type of host plant. Positive genetic correlations between resistances were stronger when both attackers were pathogens or generalist herbivores and when resistance to different enemies was tested independently, suggesting that generalists may be affected by the same plant resistance traits and that interactions among natural enemies are common. Although the mean associations between resistances were positive, indicating the prevalence of diffuse selection and generalized defenses against multiple enemies, the large variation in both the strength and the direction of the associations suggests a continuum between pairwise and diffuse selection.},

However, preference is defined as host plant choice under equal host abundance and availability, and it is likely that frequency-dependent effects will alter the actual pattern of host use beyond what preference trials reveals. The effects of such alterations are poorly known but could be important for the understanding of specialization and host shifts. We investigated how changes in frequency of a preferred and a less preferred host affected movement patterns and egg deposition within and among patches in a polyphagous butterfly, Polygonia c-album. Two experiments were carried out in large (8 × 30 m) outdoor cages, artificially divided into distinct patches with different frequencies of the two hosts: one that allowed for limited movement between patches and one that did not. There was a clear effect of frequency on patch selection; females spent more time in and laid more eggs in patches with a high frequency of the preferred host, which will potentially have a large effect on host use by modifying encounter rates in favor of the preferred host. However, there was no significant frequency-dependent plant choice within patches in any experiment. Instead, results indicate that females are distributing their eggs among plants species according to specific likelihoods of oviposition, independent of encounter rates, which is compatible with a strategy of risk-spreading.},

	abstract = {Management of wild peppers in Mexico has occurred for a long time without clear phenotypic signs of domestication. However, pre-domestication management could have implications for the population's genetic richness. To test this hypothesis we analysed 27 wild (W), let standing (LS) and cultivated (C) populations, plus 7 samples from local markets (LM), with nine polymorphic microsatellite markers. Two hundred and fifty two alleles were identified, averaging 28 per locus. Allele number was higher in W, and 15 and 40\% less in LS and C populations, respectively. Genetic variation had a significant population structure. In W populations, structure was associated with ecological and geographic areas according to isolation by distance. When LM and C populations where included in the analysis, differentiation was no longer apparent. Most LM were related to distant populations from Sierra Madre Oriental, which represents their probable origin. Historical demography shows a recent decline in all W populations. Thus, pre-domestication human management is associated with a significant reduction of genetic diversity and with a loss of differentiation suggesting movement among regions by man. Measures to conserve wild and managed populations should be implemented to maintain the source and the architecture of genetic variation in this important crop relative.},

	abstract = {White clover is polymorphic for cyanogenesis (HCN production after tissue damage), and this herbivore defence polymorphism has served as a classic model for studying adaptive variation. The cyanogenic phenotype requires two interacting biochemical components; the presence/absence of each component is controlled by a simple Mendelian gene (Ac/ac and Li/li). Climate-associated cyanogenesis clines occur in both native (Eurasian) and introduced populations worldwide, with cyanogenic plants predominating in warmer locations. Moreover, previous studies have suggested that epistatic selection may act within populations to maintain cyanogenic (AcLi) plants and acyanogenic plants that lack both components (acli plants) at the expense of plants possessing a single component (Acli and acLi plants). Here, we examine the roles of selection, gene flow and demography in the evolution of a latitudinal cyanogenesis cline in introduced North American populations. Using 1145 plants sampled across a 1650 km transect, we determine the distribution of cyanogenesis variation across the central United States and investigate whether clinal variation is adaptive or an artefact of population introduction history. We also test for the evidence of epistatic selection. We detect a clear latitudinal cline, with cyanogenesis frequencies increasing from 11\% to 86\% across the transect. Population structure analysis using nine microsatellite loci indicates that the cline is adaptive and not a by-product of demographic history. However, we find no evidence for epistatic selection within populations. Our results provide strong evidence for rapid adaptive evolution in these introduced populations, and they further suggest that the mechanisms maintaining adaptive variation may vary among populations of a species.},

However, few studies have experimentally tested the effects of tree species diversity on herbivory. In this paper, we present a meta-analysis of uniformly collected data on insect herbivore abundance and damage on three tree species (silver birch, black alder and sessile oak) from seven long-term forest diversity experiments in boreal and temperate forest zones. Our aim was to compare the effects of forest diversity on herbivores belonging to different feeding guilds and inhabiting different tree species. At the same time we also examined the variation in herbivore responses due to tree age and sampling period within the season, the effects of experimental design (plot size and planting density) and the stability of herbivore responses over time. Herbivore responses varied significantly both among insect feeding guilds and among host tree species. Among insect feeding guilds, only leaf miner densities were consistently lower and less variable in mixed stands as compared to tree monocultures regardless of the host tree species. The responses of other herbivores to forest diversity depended largely on host tree species. Insect herbivory on birch was significantly lower in mixtures than in birch monocultures, whereas insect herbivory on oak and alder was higher in mixtures than in oak and alder monocultures. The effects of tree species diversity were also more pronounced in older trees, in the earlier part of the season, at larger plots and at lower planting density. Overall our results demonstrate that forest diversity does not generally and uniformly reduce insect herbivory and suggest instead that insect herbivore responses to forest diversity are highly variable and strongly dependent on the host tree species and other stand characteristics as well as on the type of the herbivore.},

We conducted a greenhouse experiment with Plantago lanceolata and Plantago major (Plantaginaceae) in which each species served as focal plants as well as neighbors in a factorial design. In addition, we harvested plants six and nine weeks after transplantation to test whether effects changed as plants grew. In both species, competition reduced plant size, and this effect increased over time. Plantago lanceolata neighbors suppressed growth of both focal plant species more than P. major neighbors. Effects of competition on levels of secondary compounds were more complex. Concentrations of iridoid glycosides were increased by competition in both species at harvest one. By the second harvest, an effect of competition on iridoid glycosides was found only in P. major. Neighbor identity influenced levels of iridoid glycosides in P. lanceolata at harvest one; concentrations were higher in plants grown with P. lanceolata neighbors than in plants grown with P. major neighbors. We also tested whether there was a trade-off between growth (biomass) and defense (levels of iridoid glycosides). Biomass and iridoid glycoside content were significantly correlated only in plants grown with competition and harvested at nine weeks, and this relationship was positive in both species, indicating that there was no trade-off between growth and defense. This study suggests that neighbor identity could play an important role in interspecific interactions, including the interactions of plants with other trophic levels.},

	abstract = {Indirect negative interactions between prey species that share a predator, referred to as apparent competition, have been modeled extensively. However, experimental studies examining the importance of apparent competition in the field are sparse, especially in plant-herbivore systems. In this study, I examined the role of a beetle herbivore, Erynephala maritima, in mediating the indirect effects of an abundant host plant, Salicornia europaea, on a less common host species, Atriplex patula var. hastata, in New England salt marshes. To examine these relationships, I manipulated plant density (plants with vs. without neighbors) and composition (conspecific neighbors vs. Salicornia neighbors) surrounding focal Atriplex plants, as well as the presence or absence of herbivores in a field experiment. Densities of both beetle eggs and larvae were significantly greater in plots with Salicornia, suggesting that its presence increases patch location or selection by herbivores. Higher insect densities resulted in significantly higher levels of herbivore damage to Atriplex within Salicornia-addition plots compared with high- and low-density Atriplex plots. Thus the identity, and not just density, of neighboring plants is important in determining levels of herbivory. Increased herbivore damage in Salicornia-addition plots resulted in a concomitant decrease in Atriplex survival and reproductive output. Furthermore, the negative effect of Salicornia on Atriplex survival and fruit production only occurred in the presence of herbivores, indicating that competitive effects are indirect rather than direct. Thus, Salicornia has a strong apparent competitive effect on Atriplex. Cross-site surveys suggested that the pattern of increased herbivore damage to Atriplex associated with increases in local Salicornia density is common and widespread. Overall, the results suggest that the apparent competitive effect of Salicornia is likely a major determinant of patterns of Atriplex abundance both between habitat patches and across marsh zones.},

We then conducted field surveys to determine whether variation in trichome density among lupine bushes affected caterpillar spatial distribution on the landscape. Platyprepia virginalis caterpillars preferred lupine leaves with fewer trichomes in choice and no-choice experiments. In the field, caterpillar feeding damage was found more often on leaves with fewer trichomes. These preferences scaled up to the level of bushes in the landscape such that more caterpillars were found on bushes with lower trichome densities than on bushes with higher trichome densities. This is one of few studies to show the potential for trichome density to influence herbivore population size and distribution in a natural system at a landscape level. The results are consistent with trichomes functioning as a resistance mechanism with consequences for herbivore choice, performance, and distribution.},

In the temperate zone, the strength and spatial scale of these processes are likely to differ seasonally, but such differences have rarely been quantitatively examined. 2. Coverage, the area occupied by organisms, is a measure of resource use in sessile marine populations. Population models used for density-based studies should be able to characterize effectively fluctuations in coverage, but few have tried to apply such models to sessile populations. 3. We observed coverage of the intertidal barnacle Chthamalus challengeri at 20 plots on four shores along the Pacific coast of Japan over 8 years. We then fitted a population model that incorporated both a density-dependent process (strength of density dependence) and density-independent processes (intrinsic growth rate and stochastic fluctuation at different spatial scales) to these data to analyse the seasonal variation of these processes and answer the following two questions: (i) How do the effects of density-dependent and density-independent processes on population growth vary seasonally? (ii) At what spatial scale, regional (tens of kilometres), shore (hundreds of metres), or rock (tens of centimetres), does density-independent stochastic fluctuation most strongly affect population size changes? 4. Barnacle population size tended to decrease in summer, when population dynamics were characterized by a relatively lower intrinsic growth rate, weaker density dependence and stronger stochastic fluctuation. In contrast, population size tended to increase in winter, reflecting a higher intrinsic growth rate, strong density dependence and weak stochastic fluctuation. 5. In summer, population growth rate was strongly affected by regional-scale stochastic fluctuation, whereas in winter it was affected more by rock-scale stochastic fluctuation, suggesting that populations were strongly affected by regional-scale processes in summer but not in winter. 6. These results indicate that seasonally variable density-dependent and density-independent processes determine the population dynamics of C. challengeri. Therefore, to understand fluctuation patterns of populations of this species, seasonality should be taken into account. Moreover, this study demonstrates that population models commonly used for density-based studies are also applicable to coverage-based population studies.},

	abstract = {Abstract The leaf surface of a plant, especially its chemical components, constitutes the first line of resistance to herbivores and other pests. Our previous research indicated that ‘Valmaine’ (Val) romaine lettuce, Lactuca sativa L., was highly resistant to feeding by adult banded cucumber beetle, Diabrotica balteata LeConte, while ‘Tall Guzmaine’ (TG) was highly susceptible. We investigated the leaf surface chemistry of these two cultivars for its possible role in their resistance to D. balteata. Three solvents with different polarity (hexane, methylene chloride, and methanol) were tested to remove leaf surface chemicals, but only methylene chloride and methanol extracts were used in feeding bioassays. Adult D. balteata consumed much more of the leaf tissue of Val and TG when their surface chemicals were removed with methylene chloride, but not methanol, compared to nonextracted leaf tissue, leading us to hypothesize that methylene-chloride extractable leaf surface chemicals may have a role in the expression of lettuce resistance. However, leaf surface chemicals extracted from Val with methylene chloride were not a deterrent to adult D. balteata when applied to palatable lima bean leaf surfaces at various concentrations in dual-choice tests. Furthermore, the application of surface extracts from TG did not stimulate beetle feeding in similar choice tests. In a no-choice feeding test, there was no significant difference in leaf area consumption on lima bean leaves sprayed with extracts of Val or TG. These results suggest that leaf surface chemicals in romaine lettuce do not explain the resistance of Val to adult D. balteata, and that factors inside the leaf may play a role in resistance. We discuss the possibility that the solvent may have increased the palatability of lettuce leaves to D. balteata by causing enzymatic browning and cellular damage, which is likely to have degraded internal feeding deterrents and impaired the plant's ability to emit latex.},

	abstract = {It is widely recognized that stress plays an important role in directing the adaptive adjustment of an organism to changing environments. However, very little is known about the evolution of mechanisms that promote stress-induced variation. Adaptive transcriptional responses have been implicated in the evolution of tolerance to natural and anthropogenic stressors in the environment. Recent technological advances in transcriptomics provide a mechanistic understanding of biological pathways or processes involved in stress-induced phenotypic change. Furthermore, these studies are (semi) quantitative and provide insight into the reaction norms of identified target genes in response to specific stressors. We argue that plasticity in gene expression reaction norms may be important in the evolution of stress tolerance and adaptation to environmental stress. This review highlights the consequences of transcriptional plasticity of stress responses within a single generation and concludes that gene promoters containing a TATA box are more capable of rapid and variable responses than TATA-less genes. In addition, the consequences of plastic transcriptional responses to stress over multiple generations are discussed. Based on examples from the literature, we show that constitutive over expression of specific stress response genes results in stress adapted phenotypes. However, organisms with an innate capacity to buffer stress display plastic transcriptional responses. Finally, we call for an improved integration of the concept of phenotypic plasticity with studies that focus on the regulation of transcription.},

But in many situations, creating experiments and direct measurement of spatial processes can be difficult or impossible. Here, we identify and define a rapidly emerging alternative approach, which we formalize as “space as a surrogate” for unmeasured processes, that is used to maximize inference about ecological processes through the analysis of spatial patterns or spatial residuals alone. This approach requires three elements to be successful: a priori hypotheses, ecological theory and/or knowledge, and precise spatial analysis. We offer new insights into a long-standing debate about process–pattern links in ecology and highlight six recent studies that have successfully examined spatial patterns to understand a diverse array of processes: competition in forest-stand dynamics, dispersal of freshwater fish, movement of American marten, invasion mechanisms of exotic trees, dynamics of natural disturbances, and tropical-plant diversity. Key benefits of using space as a surrogate can be found where experimental manipulation or direct measurements are difficult or expensive to obtain or not possible. We note that, even where experiments can be performed, this procedure may aid in measuring the in situ importance of the processes uncovered through experiments.},

The numbers of CH and CL flower buds, flowers, immature capsules and mature capsules were counted per ramet, ramet sizes were estimated, and mature capsules were collected for seed counts.2 Both CH and CL flower numbers were positively correlated with ramet size expressed as leaf number, but the correlation was much stronger in the CL phase. CL flower production also varied significantly between years and sites. Thus, CL production in O. acetosella was not independent of resources and climatic variation.3 When the effects of year and site were taken into account, the probability of an individual flower developing into a mature fruit was not higher in the CL phase than in the CH phase.4 CL production was affected by fertilization success in the CH phase. Ramets with one or more CH flowers left unfertilized generally produced more CL buds than ramets with all their CH flowers fertilized. The former group also tended to have more seeds per CL capsule.5 Since reproductive success in the two phases varies in different temporal and spatial patterns, cleistogamy in O. acetosella is considered to be a bet-hedging strategy optimizing reproductive output in fluctuating environments.6 The findings of this study are in conflict with the general view on cleistogamy as a fail-safe mechanism for back-up seed production, unaffected by variations in resource supply and environmental conditions.},

In salt marshes in the Gulf of Mexico, the marsh periwinkle (Littoraria irrorata) is an abundant and conspicuous member of the community, climbing up the stems of marsh plants to remain out of the water at high tide. Though Littoraria are thought to primarily utilize stems of marsh cordgrass Spartina alterniflora as a source of food and refuge, Littoraria were more abundant in mixed assemblages of Spartina and Juncus roemerianus than in Spartina-only areas at the same tidal height. Mesocosm experiments confirmed that Juncus provided a refuge for Littoraria, with predation by Callinectes sapidus (but not Melongena corona) reduced when Juncus was present. However, Littoraria's utilization of Juncus as well as the effectiveness of Juncus as a refuge depended strongly on plant height: when Juncus was experimentally clipped to a shorter height than Spartina, snail abundance on Spartina and snail predation by crabs increased. Interestingly, this plant–animal refuge led to a corresponding refuge for Spartina from Littoraria: Spartina plants lost less biomass to snail grazing when growing with Juncus in mesocosm and field experiments, and Spartina plants in natural assemblages were taller when growing with Juncus than when growing alone, even in the presence of abundant snails. This example highlights the potential importance of plant–plant and plant–animal associational refuges in competitive plant assemblages.},

Other phytochemicals found in Brassica plants, such as phenols and ascorbic acid, may compliment the activity of GSLs. A survey of Brassica accessions from the national germplasm repository was conducted to identify potential cover crops that could be soil-incorporated for use as biofumigants. Ten Brassica accessions that demonstrated relative cold tolerance, rapid maturity, and superior biomass production were selected. The selected accessions were grown under three climatic conditions (fall greenhouse, winter high tunnel, and spring field) to investigate whether growing conditions affect their GSL, phenol, and ascorbic acid content. The selected accessions included seven accessions of Brassica juncea (Indian mustard), one of Brassica napus (oil seed rape), one of Brassica campestris (field mustard), and one of Eruca sativa (arugula). Separation of GSLs from the selected Brassica accessions was achieved using ion-exchange sephadex in disposable pipette tips. Quantification of total GSLs was based on inactivation of the endogenous thioglucosidase and liberation of the glucose moiety from the GSL molecule by addition of standardized thioglucosidase (myrosinase) and colorimetry. GSL concentration of greenhouse, high tunnel, and field-grown shoots (leaves and stems) averaged 24, 40 and 76 μ moles g− 1 fresh weight, respectively. Accessions of B. juncea generally had the highest GSL content. A comparison of accessions revealed that Ames 8887 of B. juncea contained the greatest GSL concentration, but had the lowest biomass yield and ascorbic acid concentration, in part because phytochemical concentration tended to be negatively correlated with biomass yield. More promising was B. juncea accession ‘Pacific Gold’ which coupled high biomass yield with above-average GSL production, but had low phenol and ascorbic acid concentration. We concluded that environmental stress on growing plants can increase the concentration of GSLs, ascorbic acid, and total phenols in Brassica shoots, but does not increase yields of these phytochemicals per unit area.},

As examples, we consider five cornerstones of ecological and evolutionary research: tests of adaptation, tradeoffs and synergisms among traits, coevolution due to species interactions, trait influences on lineage diversification, and community assembly and composition. Although several scenarios can result in a lack of concordance between historical patterns and contemporary experiments, we argue that the coupling of phylogenetic and experimental methods is an increasingly revealing approach to hypothesis testing in evolutionary ecology.},

	abstract = {Numerous reports have indicated that glucosinolates are important stimulants for specialist herbivores feeding on Brassicaceae, and that these metabolites might be present on the plant surface and thereby detectable by an alighting insect. We investigated the outermost layer of leaves of two species of Brassicaceae, Brassica napus L. var. ‘Martina’ and Nasturtium officinale R. Br., using two highly selective extraction methods. When the epicuticular wax layer was mechanically removed with gum arabic, no glucosinolates were detectable in the lower and upper leaf surfaces. Extracting the leaf surfaces with a threefold short rinse with chloroform/methanol/water (2 : 1 : 1 vol/vol/vol) led to varying results, depending on the light conditions under which plants had been kept in the period prior to extraction. In plants kept under light, glucosinolates were detectable in a first extraction in minor concentrations, with increasing amounts in a second and third extraction. In plants kept in darkness, glucosinolates were almost absent in the first extraction. We postulate that the polar glucosinolates are washed from the inner leaf tissue through open stomata to the outside during solvent extraction, but are not naturally present in the outermost wax layer. The response of the crucifer specialist Phaedon cochleariae (F.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) to leaf surfaces of the host plants B. napus and N. officinale and to a glucosinolate was tested. Adults preferred both the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces of host plants that had been treated with gum arabic in order to remove the epicuticular waxes over intact surfaces. Waxes may therefore prevent direct contact with the stimulants. Sinigrin (allyl glucosinolate) and/or surface extracts of N. officinale leaves applied on Pisum sativum leaf discs did not evoke feeding, but feeding did occur when total leaf extracts of B. napus or N. officinale were applied on this non-host. We conclude that glucosinolates might only act as feeding stimulants for P. cochleariae in concert with compounds other than surface waxes.},

The effects of both temperature and photoperiod on reproductive diapause induction were systematically investigated in this beetle. Under 16L : 8D, most of the beetles entered reproductive diapause at 12-30°C, indicating that photoperiod played a crucial role in estivation diapause induction. Under 12L : 12D, all adults developed without diapause at 28 and 30°C; less than 25\% of the individuals entered reproductive diapause at 16-24°C; however, 46.1\% of the individuals entered diapause at 12°C, suggesting that low temperature also had a relatively important influence on the determination of diapause. The photoperiodic response curves indicate that this species is a typical short-day species. The critical day-lengths at 20, 24 and 28°C were 13.2, 13.6 and 13.8 h, respectively. Transferring them from 16L : 8D to 12L : 12D or vice versa at different ages and/or stages during their development revealed that the photoperiod experienced by adults during the first 11 days might be important for diapause determination, even though an effect of photoperiod on the larval and pupal stages can not be excluded. Transferring individuals kept at a photoperiod of 12L : 12D from 25°C to 12°C or vice versa at different ages and/or stages during their development revealed that the temperature cue for diapause is mainly perceived by the late instar larvae and pupae.},

Strategic models of natural selection find stationary conditions where the two phenotypes have the same fitness. Conditions when selfing is advantageous to populations and to individuals are not usually identical. Conditions favoring self-fertilization are more stringent when selfing competes with crossing (for individual selection, i {\textbackslash}textgreater 1/2) and less stringent when selfing occurs prior to crossing (i {\textbackslash}textgreater e/2). When selfing is delayed until after all opportunities for crossing, it is always advantageous if the parameters vary independently. Some functional interactions between parameters, as when an increase in selfing simultaneously reduces the efficiency of external pollinating agents, result in stationary conditions with mixed self- and cross-fertilization under certain conditions. Following a change in the level of self-fertilization, certain evolutionary adjustments increase the advantage of the acquired mode of fertilization. The models demonstrate that the evolution of various levels of self-fertilization in plants can be explained by individual selection without recourse to postulates of long-term advantages to populations.},

This study was designed to determine the effects of fungal infection by Podosphaera plantaginis, a powdery mildew, of a shared host plant, Plantago lanceolata, on the larvae of the butterfly Melitaea cinxia. Larval responses were assessed in a no-choice feeding assay involving infected and healthy leaves, as well as in a behavioural experiment in which larvae had an opportunity to move among infected and uninfected plants. In the no-choice feeding assay larvae developed more slowly and weighed less at diapause when feeding on fungal-infected than on healthy leaves. In the behavioural experiment larval groups tended to leave the original host plant when it was infected by P. plantaginis. This tendency was associated with splitting of larval groups into smaller subgroups. These effects observed in an experimental setting were also confirmed to act under natural conditions. An analysis of 167 M. cinxia populations showed that over-winter survival of larval groups was 26\% lower in host populations infected by the mildew than in non-infected host populations. Smaller, more slowly developing larvae may not be ready to enter diapause at the onset of fall, causing the observed increase in mortality. This is the first study to demonstrate that the negative effects of a biotrophic fungal infection may extend to the dynamics of entire insect populations.},

	abstract = {1. Functional traits are increasingly used to investigate community structure, ecosystem functioning or to classify species into functional groups. These functional traits are expected to be variable between and within species. Intraspecific functional variability is supposed to influence and modulate species responses to environmental changes and their effects on their environment. However, this hypothesis remains poorly tested and species are mostly described by mean trait values without any consideration of variability in individual trait values.2. In this study, we quantify the extent of intraspecific plant functional trait variability, its spatial structure and its response to environmental factors. Using a sampling design structured along two direct and orthogonal climatic gradients in an alpine valley, we quantified and analysed the intraspecific variability for three functional traits (height, leaf dry matter content and leaf nitrogen content) measured on sixteen plant species with contrasting life histories.3. Results showed a large variability of traits within species with large discrepancies between functional traits and species. This variability did not appear to be structured within populations. Between populations, the overall variability was partly explained by the selected gradients. Despite the strong effects of temperature and radiation on trait intraspecific variability, the response curves of traits along gradients were partly idiosyncratic.4.Synthesis. Giving a comprehensive quantification of intraspecific functional variability through the analysis of an original data set, we report new evidence that using a single trait value to describe a given species can hide large functional variation for this species along environmental gradients. These findings suggest that intraspecific functional variability should be a concern for ecologists and its recognition opens new opportunities to better understand and predict ecological patterns in a changing environment. Further analyses are, however, required to compare inter- and intraspecific variability.},

Using a combination of laboratory, common garden and fieldwork we studied biology, ecology and host range of C. scrobicollis, a univoltine species that oviposits and develops in A. petiolata rosettes in fall and spring. Individual C. scrobicollis can be long-lived ({\textbackslash}textgreater2 years) and females show a second oviposition period. Weevils did not attack any of 31 test plant species outside the Brassicaceae. Within the Brassicaceae, five species allowed complete larval development under no-choice conditions. In subsequent choice tests, three of these five species (Nasturtium officinale, Peltaria alliacea and Thlaspi arvense; which are of European origin) were attacked. North American Rorippa sinuata was the only native species to be attacked by C. scrobicollis and only under no-choice conditions. Results of subsequent impact experiments showed that C. scrobicollis attack changed plant architecture but had no effect on overall plant vigour and reproductive output of R. sinuata, suggesting lack of impact on demography or population dynamics. A petition for field release of C. scrobicollis in North America has been submitted.},

In this study, we investigated the acceptance of several host plant species (Brassica rapa L. and Sinapis alba L.), commonly used by the beetle (familiar plants), and of various unfamiliar plants, including systematically and chemically related [Bunias orientalis L. (Brassicaceae) and Tropaeolum majus L. (Tropaeolaceae), both Brassicales], as well as unrelated non-host plant species [Plantago lanceolata L. (Plantaginaceae); Lamiales]. Emphasis was laid on the acceptance of the neophyte B. orientalis, and on underlying cues responsible for the acceptance of the various species. Behavioural responses to plant volatiles were studied using a static four-chamber olfactometer. Stimulants and deterrents were investigated by bioassay-guided solid phase extraction and semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography. A difference in acceptance of plant species was found: odours and polar compounds of all Brassicales evoked attraction and feeding stimulation, respectively, in Ph. cochleariae. Glucosinolates and their volatile hydrolysis products could be the main compounds that are involved in attraction of the beetles. In contrast, Ph. cochleariae did not respond to odours of the non-host P. lanceolata, and some fractions of this plant had feeding-deterrent effects, due to the presence of iridoid glycosides, among others. Although adult females accepted the neophyte B. orientalis for oviposition, neonate larvae did not survive on it. The flavonoid-containing fraction of this plant was deterrent, whereas a similar fraction had been shown to cause some feeding stimulation when derived from S. alba. Differences in qualitative and quantitative composition of related metabolites lead to differentiated plant acceptance, proving the complexity of plant cues and of insect responses that determine host acceptance behaviour. The possibility of a diet breadth enlargement to B. orientalis and the role of Ph. cochleariae as a putative native biocontrol agent of this invasive plant are discussed.},

	abstract = {An increasing body of evidence indicates that the association between different plant species may lead to a reduction in insect herbivory, i.e. associational resistance. This might be due to a top–down regulation of herbivores by increased numbers of natural enemies or to a disruptive bottom–up influence of lower host plant accessibility. In particular, the richer plant communities release more diverse plant odours that may disturb olfactory-guided host choice and mating behaviour of insect herbivores, i.e. the “semiochemical diversity hypothesis”. However, this hypothesis has been rarely tested experimentally in natural habitats, notably forest ecosystems. We tested the effects of non-host volatiles (NHV) on mate and host location by the pine processionary moth (PPM) at the scale of individual pine trees with branches of non-host tree (birch) at their base. Pheromone trap catches and the numbers of larval nests were both reduced by non-host presence under treated pine trees, confirming an associational resistance mediated by NHV. In both males and females, the antenna could detect several birch volatiles, including methyl salicylate (MeSa). MeSa inhibited the attraction of the PPM male to pheromone traps, as did bark and leaf chips from birch trees. Our test of three doses of MeSa at the habitat scale (50 m forest edges) showed that the reduction in the numbers of male PPM captured in traps and in larval nests was MeSa dose-dependent. These results show that odours released by deciduous non-host trees can reduce herbivory by a forest defoliator in conifers, providing support to the “semiochemical diversity hypothesis” as a mechanism of associational resistance.},

Migrating or dispersing offspring elsewhere is likely to decrease an individual's or its offspring's fitness, not to mention the intrinsic costs and risks of dispersal. Gene flow into a population can counteract gene frequency changes because of selection, imposing a limit on local adaptation. In addition, the migrant flow tends to be higher from densely populated to sparsely populated areas. Thus, although the potential for adaptation might be greatest in poor and sparsely populated environments, gene flow will counteract selection more strongly in such populations. Recent papers, both theoretical and empirical, have clarified the important role of migration in evolution, affecting spatial patterns, species ranges and adaptation to the environment; in particular, by emphasizing the crucial interaction between evolutionary and demographic processes.},

	abstract = {The ultimate understanding of how biological diversity arises, is maintained, and lost depends on identifying the genes responsible. Although a good deal has been discovered about gene function over the past few decades, far less is understood about gene effects, that is, how natural variation in a gene contributes to natural variation in phenotypes. Trichome density in Arabidopsis thaliana is an ideal trait for studies of natural molecular and phenotypic variation, as trichome initiation is genetically well-characterized and trichome density is highly variable in and among natural populations. Here, we show that variation at GLABRA1 (GL1), an R2R3 MYB transcription factor gene, which has a role in trichome initiation, has qualitative and likely quantitative effects on trichome density in natural accessions of A. thaliana. Specifically, we characterize four independent loss-of-function alleles for GL1, each of which yields a glabrous phenotype. Further, we find that a pattern of common polymorphisms confined to the GL1 locus is associated with quantitative variation for trichome density. While mutations resulting in a glabrous phenotype are primarily coding changes, the pattern resulting in quantitative variation spans both coding and regulatory regions. These data show that GL1 is an important source of trichome density variation within A. thaliana and, along with recent reports, suggest that the TTG1 epidermal cell fate pathway generally may be the key molecular genetic source of natural trichome density variation and an important model for the study of molecular evolution.},

Specifically, it has been suggested that if the different levels of a defence are best described as a continuous variable, then this will lead to pure ESSs with all individuals in a population adopting similar defence levels; whereas defences that can only take on discrete levels will lead to mixed ESSs (featuring variation in defence within the population). * 2Our principal aim is to determine the validity of these viewpoints, and examine how the pure and mixed strategies predicted by the two types of defences can be reconciled with practical and philosophical difficulties in defining any given defence unambiguously as continuous or discrete. * 3We present the first model of a continuously varying defence that is solved explicitly for evolutionarily stable strategies. * 4We are able to demonstrate analytically, that the model always has a unique ESS, which is always pure. This strategy may involve all members of the population adopting no defence, or all members of the population making the same non-zero investment in defence. * 5We then modify our model to restrict the defence to a number of discrete levels and demonstrate that the unique ESS in this case can be either pure or mixed. We further argue that the mixed ESS can be a combination of no more than two defence levels, and the two levels in a mixed ESS must be nearest neighbour levels in an ordered list of the levels that the defence can take. * 6This, in turn, means that the mixed ESS will be practically identical to a pure ESS if the discrete defence is fine-grained.},

We performed one generation of directional selection for low and high trichome number and scored trichome number, herbivore damage, flowering start, and fruit production of progeny planted in the field. The artificial selection resulted in significant divergence in both trichome number and flowering start. Herbivory was low, and there was no difference in herbivore damage between lines at the end of the season. High-trichome plants produced significantly more fruits than low-trichome plants, apparently because of the advantage of later flowering by high-trichome plants. The greenhouse study revealed significant genetic variation for trichome number, flowering start, and total flower number. The genetic correlations between trichome number and flowering start (positive) and between trichome number and total flower number (negative) were weak. We suggest that the high genetic variation for trichome number in this population is a function of both weak direct selection on this character and the negligible genetic and phenotypic costs of trichome production.},

Predation has been claimed to increase, decrease, or have little effect on, the strength, impact or importance of interspecific competition. There is confusion about both the meaning of these terms and the likelihood of, and conditions required for, each of these outcomes. In this article we distinguish among three measures of the influence of predation on competitive outcomes: short-term per capita consumption or growth rates, long-term changes in density, and the probability of competitive coexistence. We then outline various theoretical mechanisms that can lead to qualitatively distinct effects of predators. The qualitative effect of predators can depend both on the mechanism of competition and on the definition of competitive strength/impact. In assessing the empirical literature, we ask: (1) What definitions of competitive strength/impact have been assumed? (2) Does strong evidence exist to support one or more of the possible mechanisms that can produce a given outcome? (3) Do biases in the choice of organism or manipulation exist, and are they likely to have influenced the conclusions reached? We conclude by discussing several unanswered questions, and espouse a stronger interchange between empirical and theoretical approaches to this important question.},

	abstract = {Death feigning is fairly common in a number of taxa, but the adaptive significance of this behaviour is still unclear and has seldom been tested. To date, all proposed hypotheses have assumed that prey manage to escape predation by sending a death-mimicking signal, although death-feigning postures are markedly different from those of dead animals. Moreover, the efficacy of this technique may largely depend on the foraging mode of the predator; death feigning seldom works with sit-and-wait predators that make the decision to attack and consume prey within a very brief time. We examined whether death feigning in the pygmy grasshopper Criotettix japonicus Haan was an inducible defence behaviour against the frog Rana nigromaculata, a sit-and-wait, gape-limited predator. The characteristic posture assumed by the grasshopper during death feigning enlarges its functional body size by stretching each of three body parts (pronotum, hind legs and lateral spines) in three different directions, thereby making it difficult for the predator to swallow the prey. Our result is the first consistent explanation for why death-mimicking animals do not always mimic the posture of dead animals.},

	abstract = {Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] was one of the most important legume crops in the world in 2010. Japanese beetles (JB; Popillia japonica, Newman) in the US were an introduced and potentially damaging insect pest for soybean. JBs are likely to spread across the US if global warming occurs. Resistance to JB in soybean was previously reported only in plant introductions. The aims here were to identify loci underlying resistance to JB herbivory in recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross of Essex × Forrest cultivars (EF94) and to correlate those with loci with factors that confer insect resistance in soybean cultivars. The RIL population was used to map 413 markers, 238 satellite markers and 177 other DNA markers. Field data were from two environments over 2 years. Pest severity (PS) measured defoliation on a 0–9 scale. Pest incidence (PI) was the percentage of plants within each RIL with beetles on them. Antibiosis and antixenosis data were from feeding assays with detached leaves in petri plates. Five QTL were detected for the mean PS field trait (16\% {\textbackslash}textless R 2 {\textbackslash}textless 27\%). The loci were within the intervals Satt632–A2D8 on linkage group (LG) A2 (chromosome 8); Satt583–Satt415 on LG B1 (11); Satt009–Satt530 on LG N (3); and close to two markers OB02\_140 (LG E; 20 cM from Satt572) and OZ15\_150 LG (19 cM from Satt291 C2). Two QTL were detected for the mean PI field trait (16\% {\textbackslash}textless R 2 {\textbackslash}textless 18\%) close to Satt385 on LG A1 and Satt440 on LG I. The no choice feeding studies detected three QTL that were significant; two for antixenosis (22\% {\textbackslash}textless R 2 {\textbackslash}textless 24\%) between Satt632–A2D8 on LG A2 (8) and Sat\_039–Satt160 on LG F (13); and a major locus effect (R 2 = 54\%) for antibiosis on LG D2 (17) between Satt464–Satt488. Therefore, loci underlying resistance to JB herbivory were a mixture of major and minor gene effects. Some loci were within regions underlying resistance to soybean cyst nematode (LGs A2 and I) and root knot nematode (LG F) but not other major loci underlying resistance to nematode or insect pests (LGs G, H and M).},

Thus far, there is little evidence to suggest that specialists can detect small structural differences in secondary metabolites of their hosts, or that such differences affect host choice or performance of specialists. We tested whether phytochemical differences between closely related plant species are correlated with specialist host choice. We conducted no-choice feeding trials using 17 plant species of three genera of tribe Senecioneae (Jacobaea, Packera, and Senecio; Asteraceae) and a more distantly related species (Cynoglossum officinale; Boraginaceae) containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), and four PA-sequestering specialist herbivores of the genus Longitarsus (Chrysomelidae). We also assessed whether variation in feeding by specialist herbivores is attributable to different resource use strategies of the tested plant species. Plant resource use strategy was quantified by measuring leaf dry matter content, which is related to both plant nutritive value and to plant investment in quantitative defences. We found no evidence that intra-generic differences in PA profiles affect feeding by specialist herbivores. Instead, our results indicate that decisions to begin feeding are related to plant resource use strategy, while decisions to continue feeding are not based on any plant characteristics measured in this study. These findings imply that PA composition does not significantly affect host choice by these specialist herbivores. Leaf dry matter content is somewhat phylogenetically conserved, indicating that plants may have difficulty altering resource use strategy in response to selection pressure by herbivores and other environmental factors on an evolutionary time scale.},

	abstract = {Treelines are temperature sensitive transition zones that are expected to respond to climate warming by advancing beyond their current position. Response to climate warming over the last century, however, has been mixed, with some treelines showing evidence of recruitment at higher altitudes and/or latitudes (advance) whereas others reveal no marked change in the upper limit of tree establishment. To explore this variation, we analysed a global dataset of 166 sites for which treeline dynamics had been recorded since 1900 AD. Advance was recorded at 52\% of sites with only 1\% reporting treeline recession. Treelines that experienced strong winter warming were more likely to have advanced, and treelines with a diffuse form were more likely to have advanced than those with an abrupt or krummholz form. Diffuse treelines may be more responsive to warming because they are more strongly growth limited, whereas other treeline forms may be subject to additional constraints.},

	abstract = {Red deer cause heavy damage to forest production, hence the need to better understand what determines their dietary choices. Deer are selective herbivores. According to the optimal foraging theory (OFT), they should select foods that maximise their net rate of energy gain. For a given nutritional quality, we predict that plant architecture and height should affect deer feeding preferences through intake rate variations. In the first experiment, 12 tame red deer with shoulder height (SH) ranging from 82 to 105 cm were individually offered fresh bunches of Salix caprea at seven heights regularly spaced from 25 to 205 cm. Animals preferred bunches at 85 and 115 cm height (29 and 32\% of feeding time). There was a positive relationship between average consumption height (CH) and animal shoulder height (CH=0.99×SH; r2=0.43; P\&lt;0.05) but intake rate did not change with consumption height. In the second experiment, 10 fresh bunches of Quercus pedunculata were offered on three wooden structures, resembling a bushy topped (BT), a normal (N) and a five-shoot (FS) oak sapling. For each structure, average bunch height was set at preferred consumption height. Five tame hinds were observed during individual cafeteria trials (double- then triple-choice). Intake rate was slightly higher for FS than for the other structures (FS=23.7 g DM/min, N=22.3 g DM/min and BT=22.0 g DM/min). Preferences were expressed as the proportion of feeding time during the first min of test. In the double-choice trials, preference was higher for FS relative to BT (61\%–39\%), and for N relative to BT (62\%–38\%), but similar between FS and N (57\%–43\%). In the triple-choice trials, preference for FS (44\%), N (24\%) and BT (32\%) differed from 33\%–33\%–33\%. In both trials, there was thus a slight preference for FS, i.e. for the structure where all bunches were widely spaced and at the hinds’ preferred height. Foliage height and, to a lesser extent, structure of saplings thus affect the feeding preferences of red deer. These results can contribute to improving management practices to limit deer damages to commercial plantations.},

We recently detected latitudinal clines in SNPs frequencies and gene expression of candidate genes for growth cessation in Scandinavian populations of Norway spruce (Picea abies). Here we test whether the same clines are also present in Siberian spruce (Picea obovata), a close relative of Norway spruce with a different Quaternary history. We sequenced nine candidate genes and twenty-seven control loci and genotyped 14 SSR loci in six populations of P. obovata located along the Yenisei river from latitude 56°N to latitude 67°N. In contrast to Scandinavian Norway spruce that both departs from the standard neutral model (SNM) and shows a clear population structure, Siberian spruce populations along the Yenisei do not depart from the SNM and are genetically unstructured. Nonetheless, as in Norway spruce, growth cessation is significantly clinal. Polymorphisms in photoperiodic (FTL2) and circadian clock (Gigantea (GI), PRR3) genes also show significant clinal variation and/or evidence of local selection. In GI, one of the variants is the same as in Norway spruce. Finally, a strong cline in gene expression is observed for FTL2, but not for GI. These results, together with recent physiological studies, confirm the key role played by FTL2 and circadian clock genes in the control of growth cessation in spruce species and suggest the presence of parallel adaptation in these two species.},

	abstract = {Under many circumstances pollinators are expected to practice positive frequency–dependent foraging in colour-polymorphic plant populations. Theory suggests, however, that competition for floral resources might favor negative frequency–dependent foraging by some pollinator species, possibly contributing to the maintenance of flower colour variation by negative frequency–dependent selection. We addressed this idea with pollination studies of the California annual plant Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana (Onagraceae), which is polymorphic for the presence of conspicuous petal spots and is pollinated by several specialist bee species. At the level of entire pollinator assemblages, we did not detect significant fixed flower colour preferences or frequency–dependent foraging. Three species of specialist bee pollinators, however, showed contrasting forms of frequency–dependent foraging. The most widespread species, Hesperapis regularis (Melittidae) exhibited positive frequency dependence. Two other common species, Lasiglossum pullilabre (Halictidae) and Ceratina sequoiae (Apidae), preferred to visit whichever morph (unspotted or spotted) was locally in the minority. All three species were found to be effective at transferring C. xantiana pollen; H. regularis appeared most effective. Our findings suggest that a mixture of positive and negative frequency–dependent selection on flower colour occurs in C. xantiana, with the form and intensity of selection varying in space and time with pollinator assemblages. Negative frequency–dependent selection via pollination dynamics may play a larger role in maintaining genetic variation in flower colour than was previously thought. Our results also suggest an unappreciated form of niche partitioning among specialist pollinators. Genetic polymorphism in flower colour may sometimes facilitate pollinator coexistence.},

Some mature plants are covered primarily with nonglandular trichomes, while others possess glandular trichomes that excrete a sticky exudate. Other phenotypes were found in nearly all southern California plant populations surveyed. The frequencies of glandular (sticky) and nonglandular (velvety) phenotypes, however, varied significantly among populations. By employing reciprocal hybridization and backcross designs, we showed that trichome phenotype is inherited largely in a Mendelian fashion. The allele coding for the sticky phenotype was dominant over that for the velvety phenotype. The expression of the recessive gene was age dependent; velvety phenotypes produced glandular trichomes on their cotyledons and the first five true leaves. Thereafter these plants produced nonglandular trichomes on all newer leaves. We hypothesize that feeding by herbivorous insects and/or water stress may play a role in maintaining this polymorphism in natural plant populations.},

	abstract = {(1) Populations of Plantago lanceolata were grown in a reciprocal-transplant experiment in an early-mown hayfield, a wet, late-mown hayfield and a pasture. At all three sites, populations and clones differed significantly in components of seed yield such as survival, incidence of flowering and seed set, and in annual seed yield. (2) Components of seed yield of transplants were correlated with the height of the surrounding vegetation. In the pasture, plants produced far more seeds in tall vegetation, which was probably due to a low local grazing intensity. In contrast, in the early-mown hayfield tall vegetation was associated with a lower lifetime seed yield. At all three sites, tall vegetation coincided with a low survival of transplants. (3) In the early-mown hayfield selection on timing of flowering and growth habit was found, which agreed with the expectations from the observed differences between populations. At all sites seed production varied above all because of differences in plant size, and no further direct effects of phenotypic traits on seed yield could be detected. (4) Specialization of clones to certain sites was tested by calculating correlations of seed-yield components across sites. No significant correlations were found between components of seed yield per clone across sites. This was probably due to the positive correlation of the mean plant size per clone at different sites. A trade-off between vegetative growth and reproduction is suggested as a possible cause.},

	abstract = {There is a recognized need to anticipate tipping points, or critical transitions, in social-ecological systems. Studies of mathematical and experimental systems have shown that systems may /`wobble/' before a critical transition. Such early warning signals may be due to the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which causes a system to recover slowly from small impacts, or to a flickering phenomenon, which causes a system to switch back and forth between alternative states in response to relatively large impacts. Such signals for transitions in social-ecological systems have rarely been observed, not the least because high-resolution time series are normally required. Here we combine empirical data from a lake-catchment system with a mathematical model and show that flickering can be detected from sparse data. We show how rising variance coupled to decreasing autocorrelation and skewness started 10-30 years before the transition to eutrophic lake conditions in both the empirical records and the model output, a finding that is consistent with flickering rather than critical slowing down. Our results suggest that if environmental regimes are sufficiently affected by large external impacts that flickering is induced, then early warning signals of transitions in modern social-ecological systems may be stronger, and hence easier to identify, than previously thought.},

As a main web application of ReSpect, a fragment search was established based on only the m/z values of query data and records. The confidence levels of the annotations were managed using the MS/MS fragmentation association rule, which is an algorithm for discovering common fragmentations in MS/MS data. Using this data resource and database, a case study was conducted for the annotation of untargeted MS/MS data that were selected after quantitative trait locus analysis of the accessions (Gifu and Miyakojima) of a model legume Lotus japonicus.

We investigated genetic variation for inducibility of defensive traits in wild radish plants and asked if the evolution of induction is constrained by costs of phenotypic plasticity. In a greenhouse experiment using paternal half-sibling families, we show additive genetic variation for plasticity in glucosinolate concentration. Genetic variation for glucosinolates was not detected in undamaged plants, but was significant following herbivory by a specialist herbivore, Pieris rapae. On average, damaged plants had 55\% higher concentrations of glucosinolates compared to controls. In addition, we found significant narrow-sense heritabilities for leaf size, trichome number, flowering phenology, and lifetime fruit production. In a second experiment, we found evidence of genetic variation in induced plant resistance to P. rapae. Although overall there was little evidence for genetic correlations between the defensive and life-history traits we measured, we show that more plastic families had lower fitness than less plastic families in the absence of herbivory (i.e., evidence for genetic costs of plasticity). Thus, there is genetic variation for induction of defense in wild radish, and the evolution of inducibility may be constrained by costs of plasticity.},

Toxicities of the intact avocado idioblast oil cells and the extracted idioblast oil were compared for three insect herbivores. Spodoptera exigua (Hübner) larvae are generalists that do not feed on avocados. By contrast, Sabulodes aegrotata (Guenée) and Pseudoplusia includens (Walker) larvae are generalist herbivores that readily feed on avocados. All bioassays were performed at a naturally occurring concentration of idioblast oil cells (2\% w/w). Choice experiments showed that S. exigua larvae avoided diet treated with avocado idioblast oil cells and consume more control than treated diet. In contrast, idioblast oil cells had no significant antifeedant effects on the adapted S. aegrotata and P. includens larvae. Subsequent experiments designed to assess resistance mechanisms separated pre-ingestive (behavioral) and post-ingestive (physiological) effects of the avocado idioblast oil cells, and the extracted idioblast oil, on the two adapted herbivores. Post-ingestive adaptation was the mechanism that allows feeding. Because the impact of the avocado idioblast oil cells was greatest on the performance of non-adapted S. exigua, additional experiments determined that larvae fed diet containing the oil cells had higher mortality and reduced larval growth compared to controls. Developmental times were significantly prolonged for the survivors. Thus, increased mortality, reduced developmental rates, and antifeedant activity in the non-adapted insect indicate that defense against non-adapted herbivores may be an important function of idioblast cells in avocados.},

This neighborhood effect was limited to plants immediately adjacent to a host plant; pod density {\textbackslash}textgreater3 m distant from hosts had little influence on colonization of hosts by bugs. Mark-recapture studies revealed differences in responses of the two sexes of L. kalmii to neighboring pod density: males lingered longer, while females lingered less on individual plants when these plants were surrounded by many vs. few pods.

Here we describe the development of genomic tools and resources for 11 weeds from the Compositae family that will serve as a basis for subsequent population and comparative genomic analyses. Because hybridization has been suggested as a stimulus for the evolution of invasiveness, we also analyze these genomic data for evidence of hybridization. • Methods: We generated 22 expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries for the 11 targeted weeds using Sanger, 454, and Illumina sequencing, compared the coverage and quality of sequence assemblies, and developed NimbleGen microarrays for expression analyses in five taxa. When possible, we also compared the distributions of Ks values between orthologs of congeneric taxa to detect and quantify hybridization and introgression. • Results: Gene discovery was enhanced by sequencing from multiple tissues, normalization of cDNA libraries, and especially greater sequencing depth. However, assemblies from short sequence reads sometimes failed to resolve close paralogs. Substantial introgression was detected in Centaurea and Helianthus, but not in Ambrosia and Lactuca. • Conclusions: Transcriptome sequencing using next-generation platforms has greatly reduced the cost of genomic studies of nonmodel organisms, and the ESTs and microarrays reported here will accelerate evolutionary and molecular investigations of Compositae weeds. Our study also shows how ortholog comparisons can be used to approximately estimate the genome-wide extent of introgression and to identify genes that have been exchanged between hybridizing taxa.},

	abstract = {Circadian clocks are signalling networks that enhance an organism's relationship with the rhythmic environment. The plant circadian clock modulates a wide range of physiological and biochemical events, such as stomatal and organ movements, photosynthesis and induction of flowering. Environmental signals regulate the phase and period of the plant circadian clock, which results in an approximate synchronization of clock outputs with external events. One of the consequences of circadian control is that stimuli of the same strength applied at different times of the day can result in responses of different intensities. This is known as ‘gating’. Gating of a signal may allow plants to better process and react to the wide range and intensities of environmental signals to which they are constantly subjected. Light signalling, stomatal movements and low-temperature responses are examples of signalling pathways that are gated by the circadian clock. In this review, we describe the many levels at which the circadian clock interacts with responses to the environment. We discuss how environmental rhythms of temperature and light intensity entrain the circadian clock, how photoperiodism may be regulated by the relationship between environmental rhythms and the phasing of clock outputs, and how gating modulates the sensitivity of the clock and other responses to environmental and physiological signals. Finally, we describe evidence that the circadian clock can increase plant fitness.},

	abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) constitutes a class of computational methods rooted in Bayesian statistics. In all model-based statistical inference, the likelihood function is of central importance, since it expresses the probability of the observed data under a particular statistical model, and thus quantifies the support data lend to particular values of parameters and to choices among different models. For simple models, an analytical formula for the likelihood function can typically be derived. However, for more complex models, an analytical formula might be elusive or the likelihood function might be computationally very costly to evaluate. ABC methods bypass the evaluation of the likelihood function. In this way, ABC methods widen the realm of models for which statistical inference can be considered. ABC methods are mathematically well-founded, but they inevitably make assumptions and approximations whose impact needs to be carefully assessed. Furthermore, the wider application domain of ABC exacerbates the challenges of parameter estimation and model selection. ABC has rapidly gained popularity over the last years and in particular for the analysis of complex problems arising in biological sciences (e.g., in population genetics, ecology, epidemiology, and systems biology).},

Such changes have been termed time-dependent. In biological control, candidate agents are tested in a variety of cage assays in order to determine the limits of their host range. These assays commonly include choice tests including the target species, simultaneous no-choice tests, and sequential no-choice tests. We consider the possible influence of time-dependent changes in acceptance threshold on the likely outcomes of each of these kinds of tests. Results that may under-estimate the field host range of candidate agents are deemed to be most likely from choice tests that include a highly ranked host, and any no-choice assay conducted over a short period. We recommend: (i) that choice tests including the target species and sequential no-choice tests with a short period of access to non-target species, should not be employed as the only type of test, or for any initial screening; and (ii) that more attention be paid to the temporal profiles of feeding and oviposition by the candidate agent, especially in no-choice tests.},

	abstract = {The Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) is an agriculturally important pest of wheat. A mariner element (Desmar1) has been previously identified in the Hessian fly genome. Using Desmar1 as a probe, we isolated individual copies of Desmar-like elements from the Hessian fly genome cloned in bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) and studied their structural variability and flanking DNA sequences. The partial Desmar-like copies are relatively more abundant (∼64\%) than full length copies (∼36\%) in the Hessian fly genome. Most of the full length copies are consistently flanked by an EcoRI restriction site that occurs 32 bp from one end and 66 bp from the other end of the mariner. Using an amplified fragment length polymorphism-PCR (AFLP-PCR) based method, we identified segregating polymorphisms associated with Desmar elements in a F2 mapping population. We were able to use the segregation data to localize the chromosomal position of three Desmar elements by linkage analysis. As paternal chromosomes are eliminated in the Hessian fly during early embryogenesis, two-thirds of the AFLPs were expected to be polymorphic in the mapping population and this was observed for AFLPs anchored to full length Desmar copies but not to the partial copies. Thus, our data indicate that dead and partial Desmar-like copies are probably associated with less polymorphic regions and may represent mariner graveyards in the Hessian fly genome.},

The food choice, leaf consumption and growth of A. asclepiadis larvae were studied to determine whether there is variation among and within host-plant populations in their suitability for this specialist herbivore. There was significant variation in food preference and leaf consumption among host-plant populations, but no differences were found in larval growth and feeding on different host-plant populations. A. asclepiadis larvae preferred host-plant populations with higher alkaloid concentrations, but did not consume more leaf material from plants originating from such populations in a no-choice experiment. There was also some variation in food preference of larvae among host-plant individuals belonging to the same population, suggesting that there was variability in leaf chemistry also within populations. Such variation in larval preference among host-plant genotypes and populations may create potential for coevolutionary dynamics in a spatial mosaic.},

	abstract = {Plant trichomes commonly serve a role in mechanical and chemical defence against herbivores, but may also have the potential to alter physiology by reducing the amount of light absorbed by leaves, lowering temperatures, and reducing water loss. Populations of Datura wrightii Regel in southern California produce 'sticky' plants with glandular trichomes and 'velvety' plants bearing non-glandular trichomes. Because stickiness is inherited as a dominant Mendelian trait, and the proportions of sticky plants vary among populations with the moisture availability of their environment, there may be some ecophysiological differences between trichome types that contribute to their ability to survive in a particular geographic location. To examine the possible physiological significance of trichome variation, we measured the spectral properties, midday gas-exchange rates, and water potentials of D. wrightii leaves from sticky and velvety plants growing in a field experiment. The differences in leaf reflectance (0.9\%) and absorptance (1.3\%) of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) between trichome types are too small to have any direct physiologically significant effect. Simulations of leaf temperatures based on the difference in leaf absorptances reveal that leaf temperature would be no more than 1degreesC lower in velvety compared to sticky plants. Gas-exchange measurements revealed no significant difference between types in their transpiration rates or stomatal conductances. In this case, trichome variation may be more important to plant defenses than to physiology.},

The significant isolation by distance allowed us to reject the infinite island model of migration.4 Gene flow parameters were higher in the upper, mountainous part than in the alluvial plain downstream. There was no accumulation of diversity downstream, indicating migration rates were symmetrical upstream and downstream. This was confirmed by computing individual migration parameters between adjacent populations.5 The results are discussed with regard to the dispersal mechanisms of seeds and pollen. The discrepancy between potential gene flow and effective gene flow is interpreted as an effect of fragmentation, due to the alteration of the natural dynamics of the riparian ecosystem rather than to physical barriers.},

We conducted a meta-analysis of 161 peer-reviewed studies reporting 493 experimental manipulations of prey diversity to test whether diet mixing enhances consumer fitness based on the intrinsic nutritional quality of foods and consumer physiology. Averaged across studies, mixed diets conferred significantly higher fitness than the average of single-species diets, but not the best single prey species. More than half of individual experiments, however, showed maximal growth and reproduction on mixed diets, consistent with the predicted benefits of a balanced diet. Mixed diets including chemically defended prey were no better than the average prey type, opposing the prediction that a diverse diet dilutes toxins. Finally, mixed-model analysis showed that the effect of diet mixing was stronger for herbivores than for higher trophic levels. The generally weak evidence for the nutritional benefits of diet mixing in these primarily laboratory experiments suggests that diet generalism is not strongly favored by the inherent physiological benefits of mixing food types, but is more likely driven by ecological and environmental influences on consumer foraging.},

These generalist herbivores are challenged with a diversity of dietary choices that can impact their survival, development and fecundity. In the present study, dietary choices of S. exigua caterpillars, based on the protein to digestible carbohydrate (P : C) ratio of the food, and the impact of nutritionally unbalanced foods on caterpillar performance are assessed. In choice experiments, individual third-instar caterpillars are offered simultaneously a P-biased and a C-biased food until pupation. Caterpillars feed nonrandomly and select a slightly P-biased diet (22P : 20C). In no-choice experiments, second instar caterpillars are reared until pupation on diets ranging in P : C ratio from extremely P- to extremely C-biased. High mortality and delayed development are observed on the C-rich, P-poor diets, highlighting the potential deleterious effects of excess carbohydrates and the importance of protein for growth and development. Diet-dependent differences in pupal weight or pupal lipid reserves are not observed. This contrasts with closely-related Spodoptera species where pupal mass and lipid stores increase on C-rich, P-poor diets. On the extremely P-biased diet, performance is similar to that of individuals reared on the self-selected diet, suggesting that these caterpillars may efficiently be deaminating excess amino acids to generate carbon skeletons, which are shunted into lipid biosynthesis. Spodoptera exigua caterpillars exhibit flexible and efficient pre-ingestive nutrient intake regulation and post-ingestive utilization, allowing these generalist feeders to cope with the heterogeneous diets they may encounter.},

The presence of plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) in the beetle's digestive tract makes this degradation possible. Sequences encoding these beetle-derived PCWDEs were originally identified from transcriptomes and strikingly resemble those of saprophytic and phytopathogenic microorganisms, raising questions about their origin; e.g. are they insect- or microorganism-derived? To demonstrate unambiguously that the genes encoding PCWDEs found in beetle transcriptomes are indeed of insect origin, we generated a bacterial artificial chromosome library from the genome of the leaf beetle Chrysomela tremula, containing 18 432 clones with an average size of 143 kb. After hybridizing this library with probes derived from 12 C. tremula PCWDE-encoding genes and sequencing the positive clones, we demonstrated that the latter genes are encoded by the insect's genome and are surrounded by genes possessing orthologues in the genome of Tribolium castaneum as well as in three other beetle genomes. Our analyses showed that although the level of overall synteny between C. tremula and T. castaneum seems high, the degree of microsynteny between both species is relatively low, in contrast to the more closely related Colorado potato beetle.},

	abstract = {Theory predicts that bottom-up ecological forces can affect community dynamics, but whether this extends to the effects of heritable plant variation on tritrophic communities is poorly understood. In a field experiment, I contrasted the effects of plant genotype (28 genotypes; 1064 plants), aphid density, and the presence/absence of mutualistic ants in affecting the per capita population growth of a specialist aphid herbivore, as well as the effects of plant genotype on the third trophic level. Plant genotype strongly affected aphid population growth rate, explaining 29\% of the total variation in growth rate, whereas aphid density and ant—aphid interactions explained substantially less variation ({\textbackslash}textless2\%) in aphid population growth rate. Plant genotype also had direct and indirect effects on the third trophic level, affecting the abundance of aphid-tending ants and the richness of predators. Multiple regression identified several heritable plant traits that explained 49\% of the variation in aphid growth rate and 30\% of the variation in ant abundance among plant genotypes. These bottom-up effects of plant genotype on tritrophic interactions were independent of the effects of either initial aphid density or the presence/absence of mutualistic ants. This study shows that plant genotype can be one of the most important ecological factors shaping tritrophic communities.},

	abstract = {Abstract.— Pathogens have the potential to maintain genetic polymorphisms by creating frequency-dependent selection on their host. This can occur when a rare host genotype is less likely to be attacked by a pathogen (frequency-dependent disease attack) and has higher fitness at low frequency (negative frequency-dependent selection). In this study, we used wheat genotypes that were susceptible to different races of the pathogen Puccinia striiformis to test whether disease created frequency-selection on its host and whether such selection could maintain polymorphisms for resistance genes in the wheat populations. Four different two-way mixtures of wheat genotypes were planted at different frequencies in both the presence and absence of disease. Disease created frequency-dependent selection on its host in some populations. Unknown factors other than disease also created frequency-dependent selection in this system because, in some instances, rare genotype advantage was observed in the absence of disease. Although the pathogen created frequency-dependent selection on its host, this selection was not sufficient to maintain genetic polymorphism in the host populations. In all cases where frequency-dependent selection occurred only in the diseased plots, one of the two genotypes was predicted to dominate in the population and the same genotype was predicted to dominate in both the presence and absence of disease. Only in cases where frequency-dependent selection was not caused by disease was there evidence that genetic polymorphisms would be maintained in the population. The frequency-dependent selection described in this study is a consequence of epidemiological effects of disease and differs from the time-lagged frequency-dependent selection resulting from coevolution between hosts and parasites. The impact of this direct frequency-dependent selection on the maintenance of genetic polymorphisms in the host population is discussed.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary history of a set of taxa is usually represented by a phylogenetic tree, and this model has greatly facilitated the discussion and testing of hypotheses. However, it is well known that more complex evolutionary scenarios are poorly described by such models. Further, even when evolution proceeds in a tree-like manner, analysis of the data may not be best served by using methods that enforce a tree structure but rather by a richer visualization of the data to evaluate its properties, at least as an essential first step. Thus, phylogenetic networks should be employed when reticulate events such as hybridization, horizontal gene transfer, recombination, or gene duplication and loss are believed to be involved, and, even in the absence of such events, phylogenetic networks have a useful role to play. This article reviews the terminology used for phylogenetic networks and covers both split networks and reticulate networks, how they are defined, and how they can be interpreted. Additionally, the article outlines the beginnings of a comprehensive statistical framework for applying split network methods. We show how split networks can represent confidence sets of trees and introduce a conservative statistical test for whether the conflicting signal in a network is treelike. Finally, this article describes a new program, SplitsTree4, an interactive and comprehensive tool for inferring different types of phylogenetic networks from sequences, distances, and trees.},

In cruciferous species, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and ethylene along with glucosinolates and their hydrolysis products play important roles in plant protection and plant–insect communication. In turn, a number of herbivores have adapted to plants that contain glucosinolates. As a result of adaptation to their host plants, specialized insects may elicit different plant-inducible responses than generalists. Oligonucleotide microarrays and qRT–PCR analysis were used to characterize transcriptional profiles of Arabidopsis thaliana plants in response to infestation with a generalist aphid, Myzus persicae, or a cruciferous plant specialist, Brevicoryne brassicae. To find possible differences and similarities in molecular responses between plants differing in predominant glucosinolate hydrolysis products, three ecotypes of A. thaliana were chosen: Wassilewskija (Ws), Cape Verde Islands (Cvi), and Landsberg erecta (Ler), which, respectively, produce mainly isothiocyanates, epithionitriles, and nitriles. In all three ecotypes, general stress-responsive genes, genes belonging to octadecanoid and indole glucosinolate synthesis pathways were induced upon both generalist and specialist attack. By contrast, transcription of myrosinases, enzymes hydrolysing glucosinolates, was suppressed. The induction of the jasmonic acid synthesis pathway was strongest in Cvi, while the up-regulation of the indole glucosinolate synthesis pathway was highest in Ler, suggesting a slightly different defence strategy in these two ecotypes. Specialist and generalist infestations caused statistically significant differential regulation of 60 genes in Ws and 21 in Cvi. Among these were jasmonic acid and tryptophan synthesis pathway enzymes, and pathogenesis related protein (PR1). Insect no-choice experiments revealed lowered fitness of B. brassicae on Ler and Cvi in comparison to Ws, but no ecotype-dependent change in fecundity of M. persicae. Targeted studies employing constructs of GUS reporter gene under the control of promoters from CYP79B2 and CYP79B3 genes showed insect-specific induction of the indole glucosinolates synthesis pathway.},

	abstract = {Mimicry, in which one prey species (the Mimic) imitates the aposematic signals of another prey (the Model) to deceive their predators, has attracted the general interest of evolutionary biologists. Predator psychology, especially how the predator learns and forgets, has recently been recognized as an important factor in a predator–prey system. This idea is supported by both theoretical and experimental evidence, but is also the source of a good deal of controversy because of its novel prediction that in a Model/Mimic relationship even a moderately unpalatable Mimic increases the risk of the Model (quasi-Batesian mimicry). We developed a psychology-based Monte Carlo model simulation of mimicry that incorporates a “Pavlovian” predator that practices an optimal foraging strategy, and examined how various ecological and psychological factors affect the relationships between a Model prey species and its Mimic. The behavior of the predator in our model is consistent with that reported by experimental studies, but our simulation's predictions differed markedly from those of previous models of mimicry because a more abundant Mimic did not increase the predation risk of the Model when alternative prey were abundant. Moreover, a quasi-Batesian relationship emerges only when no or very few alternative prey items were available. Therefore, the availability of alternative prey rather than the precise method of predator learning critically determines the relationship between Model and Mimic. Moreover, the predation risk to the Model and Mimic is determined by the absolute density of the Model rather than by its density relative to that of the Mimic. Although these predictions are counterintuitive, they can explain various kinds of data that have been offered in support of competitive theories. Our model results suggest that to understand mimicry in nature it is important to consider the likely presence of alternative prey and the possibility that predation pressure is not constant.},

We examined the impact of sequencing effort on transcriptome recovery and overlap among individuals. To do this, we developed two novel publicly available software pipelines: SnoWhite for read cleaning before assembly, and AllelePipe for clustering of loci and allele identification in assembled datasets with or without a reference genome. AllelePipe is designed specifically for cases in which read depth information is not appropriate or available to assist with disentangling closely related paralogs from allelic variation, as in transcriptome or previously assembled libraries. We find that modest applications of sequencing effort recover most of the novel sequences present in the transcriptome of this species, including single-copy loci and a representative distribution of functional groups. In contrast, the coverage of variable sites, observation of heterozygosity, and overlap among different libraries are all highly dependent on sequencing effort. Nevertheless, the information gained from overlapping regions was informative regarding coarse population structure and variation across our small number of population samples, providing the first genetic evidence in support of hypothesized invasion scenarios.},

We measured the effectiveness of all common flower visitors to Asclepias tuberosa (butterfly weed) at a site in southeastern Arizona, in terms of visitation rate, per-visit rate of pollinia removal and insertion, and pollinia load. Bombus and Apis (Hymenoptera) were the most effective pollinators, counter to predictions that A. tuberosa is butterfly-pollinated. We also documented large differences between 2 yr in the pollination effectiveness of visitors, primarily due to changes in visitation rate. Bombus were the most frequent and effective pollinators in 1992. In 1993, Apis were equivalent to Bombus. Battus (Lepidoptera) were the second most effective pollinators in 1992, but were scarce in 1993. Thus, conclusions about the identity of effective pollinators based on floral traits, casual observations of visitation, or even precise measurement of effectiveness in a single season are all potentially suspect.

The moor frog (Rana arvalis) shows strong phenotypic divergence along an acidification gradient in Sweden. We here used correlations among population pairwise estimates of quantitative trait (PST or QST from common garden estimates of embryonic acid tolerance and larval life-history traits) and neutral genetic divergence (FST from neutral microsatellite markers), as well as environmental differences (pond pH, predator density, and latitude), to test whether this phenotypic divergence is more likely due to divergent selection or neutral processes. We found that trait divergence was more strongly correlated with environmental differences than the neutral marker divergence, suggesting that divergent natural selection has driven phenotypic divergence along the acidification gradient. Moreover, pairwise PSTs of embryonic acid tolerance and QSTs of metamorphic size were strongly correlated with breeding pond pH, whereas pairwise QSTs of larval period and growth rate were more strongly correlated with geographic distance/latitude and predator density, respectively. We suggest that incorporating measurements of environmental variation into QST–FST studies can improve our inferential power about the agents of natural selection in natural populations.},

Among induction treatments, gypsy moth feeding had the strongest and most consistent effect in behavioral choice tests. Mechanical wounding of leaves and mechanical wounding plus application of gypsy moth regurgitant had intermediate effects, while application of jasmonic acid had the weakest overall effect. Under no-choice conditions, there were no consistent trends across clones in the ability of various treatments to elicit plant responses affecting the herbivore. Levels of constitutive and inducible resistance to herbivory varied significantly among 12 Populus clones. Larvae grew up to 30-fold more, and consumed up to 250-fold more on the most suitable than the least suitable clone. Prior feeding by gypsy moths reduced larval feeding up to 71.4\% on the most highly inducible clone, but it had little or no effect for the least inducible clones. There was no evidence for a relationship between levels of inducible and constitutive resistance, or between inducible resistance and phylogenetic relatedness among clones.

	abstract = {The food quality of a given host plant tissue will influence the performance and may also affect the preference behavior of herbivorous animals. As nutrient contents and defense metabolite concentrations can vary significantly between different parts of a plant and change over time, herbivores are potentially confronted with diet differing in quality even when feeding on a single plant individual. Here we investigated to what extent feeding exclusively either on young or old, mature leaves of Brassica rapa or on a mixed diet of young and old leaves offered in alternating order affects the larval performance, food consumption, and the host preference behavior of adult mustard leaf beetles, Phaedon cochleariae. Analyzing different leaf quality traits, we found lower water contents, no changes in C:N ratio but more than threefold higher glucosinolate concentrations in young compared to old leaves. Individuals reared on mixed diet performed as well as animals reared on young leaves. Thus, compared to animals feeding exclusively on highly nutritious young leaves, diet-mixing individuals may balance the lower nutrient intake by a dilution of adverse secondary metabolites. Alternatively, they may integrate over the variation in their food, using a previously assimilated resource for growth at times of scarcity. Animals reared on old leaves grew less and had a prolonged larval developmental time, although they showed increased consumption indicating compensatory feeding. Additionally, we found that experience with a certain diet affected the preference behavior. Whereas individuals reared exclusively on young leaves preferred young over old leaves for feeding and oviposition, we did not find any preferences by animals reared exclusively on old leaves or by females reared on alternating diet. Thus, in contrast to positive feedbacks for animals reared on young leaves, an integrative growth of diet-mixing individuals potentially leads to a lack of feedback during development. Taken together, our results suggest that different diet regimes can lead to comparable performance of mustard leaf beetles but experienced feedbacks may differ and thus convey distinct diet preferences.},

Many of these questions are addressed here with an analysis of genome-wide variation at 10 loci in 475 individuals from 167 globally distributed populations, including many from critical but previously un-sampled regions. Rooted haplotype networks at three loci suggest that A. thaliana arose in the Caucasus region. Identification of large-scale metapopulations indicates clear east–west genetic structure, both within proposed Pleistocene refugia and post-Pleistocene colonized regions. The refugia themselves are genetically differentiated from one another and display elevated levels of within-population genetic diversity relative to recolonized areas. The timing of an inferred demographic expansion coincides with the Eemian interglacial (approximately 120 000 years ago). Taken together, these patterns are strongly suggestive of Pleistocene range dynamics. Spatial autocorrelation analyses indicate that isolation by distance is pervasive at all hierarchical levels, but that it is reduced in portions of Europe.},

The pest species tested were Pieris rapae (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) (the small white butterfly), Pieris brassicae (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) (the large white butterfly), Delia radicum (Diptera: Anthomyiidae) (the cabbage root fly), Phaedon cochleariae (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) (the mustard beetle), Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae) (the diamond-back moth), Evergestis forficalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) (the garden-pebble moth), Mamestra brassicae (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) (the cabbage moth) and Brevicoryne brassicae (Hemiptera: Aphididae) (the cabbage aphid). In all tests, except two in which the brassica plants were about three times as high as the clover background, 39\%–100\% fewer of the pest insect stage monitored were found on host plants presented in clover than on those presented in bare soil. Contrary to claims supporting the ‘enemies hypothesis’, differences in colonization alone appeared sufficient to account for the lower numbers of insects found when host plants are undersown with clover. To be effective in reducing plant colonization, the clover must cover 50\%, and preferably more, of the vertical profile of the crop plants. As clover used as an undersown crop often has to be cut to make it less competitive with the main brassica crop, temporal aspects of the condition of the clover during critical periods of pest activity need to be recorded carefully before concluding that undersowing does not produce the effect desired against certain pest species under field conditions. The effective clover barrier is like any other treatment, if it is not present at the appropriate time it cannot be expected to reduce pest insect numbers.},

	abstract = {Frequency-dependent prey choice by natural enemies may influence the coexistence of multiple prey types, but little is known about whether frequency-dependent foraging choice occurs in herbivory on plants showing resistance polymorphism within a single population. Here we examined frequency-dependent foraging by a crucifer-feeding leaf beetle, Phaedon brassicae, on trichome-producing (hairy) and trichomeless (glabrous) plants coexisting within a natural population of the perennial herb Arabidopsis halleri subsp. gemmifera. Larvae of P. brassicae fed on hairy leaves showed slower growth than those fed on glabrous leaves. Although adult beetles consumed similar amounts of leaves when they were fed either hairy or glabrous leaves in no-choice conditions, our choice experiment showed that adult beetles fed at less than the proportionally expected level on hairy leaves compared to glabrous leaves when the hairy leaves were less or equally abundant. Both types of leaves were consumed at the proportionally expected levels when the hairy leaves were more abundant than the glabrous leaves. In a natural population, the leaf damage on the hairy plants was negatively correlated with the local proportion of the glabrous plants in a 1-m diameter patch across 2 years, while correlations between the leaf damage on the glabrous plants and their proportion differed between the 2 years. Additionally, we found five glucosinolates in leaves of A. halleri, but their accumulation did not differ between hairy and glabrous plants. Our experimental results indicate that hairy plants incur less herbivory by P. brassicae when glabrous plants are abundant. The field pattern provides evidence suggestive of frequency-dependent herbivory acting on hairy plants. The present study highlights one of the putative mechanisms of maintaining plant resistance polymorphism.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity is commonly considered as a trait associated with invasiveness in alien plants because it may enhance the ability of plants to occupy a wide range of environments. Although the evidence of greater phenotypic plasticity in invasive plants is considerable, it is not yet conclusive. We used a meta-analysis approach to evaluate whether invasive plant species show greater phenotypic plasticity than their native or non-invasive counterparts. The outcome of such interspecific comparisons may be biased when phylogenetic relatedness is not taken into account. Consequently, species pairs belonged to the same genus, tribe or family. The meta-analysis included 93 records from 35 studies reporting plastic responses to light, nutrients, water, CO2, herbivory and support availability. Contrary to what is often assumed, overall, phenotypic plasticity was similar between invasive plants and native or non-invasive closely related species. The same result was found when separate analyses were conducted for trait plasticity to nutrients, light and water availability. Thus, invasive plant species and their native or non-invasive counterparts are equally capable of displaying functional responses to environmental heterogeneity. The colonization of a wide range of environments by invasive plants could be due to their capacity to undergo adaptive ecotypic differentiation rather than to their ability to display plastic responses. Alternatively, phenotypic plasticity might play a role in plant invasion, but only during the initial phases, when tolerance of the novel environment is essential for plant survival. Afterwards, once alien plants are identified as invaders, the magnitude of phenotypic plasticity might be reduced after selection of the optimum phenotypes in each habitat. The identification of plant traits that consistently predict invasiveness might be a futile task because different traits favor invasiveness in different environments. Approaches at the local scale, focusing on the ecology of specific invasive plants, could be more fruitful than global macro-analyses.},

Individual rosette mortality was related to plant age and size. (3) An exponential decay model (Deevey type II) gave a statistically significant fit for seedling cohorts, vegetatively-derived rosettes and population depletion curves. (4) Half-lives of seedling cohorts ranged from 4.3 weeks to 80.5 weeks and decreased progressively during the study. (5) Rosette mortality was density-dependent at both sites. Statistically significant relationships between plant mortality, cohort half-life, and prevailing population density were found. The role of density-dependent mortality and site disturbances in the maintenance of the populations is discussed.},

However, the role of terpenoid mixtures, either constitutive or induced, their intraspecific qualitative and quantitative compositional variation, and their dosage-dependent effects are emphasized in subsequent discussions. It is suggested that little previous attention to these characteristics may have contributed to terpenoids having been misrepresented in some chemical defense theories. Selected phytocentric examples of terpenoid interactions are presented: (1) defense against generalist and specialist insect and mammalian herbivores, (2) defense against insect-vectored fungi and potentially pathogenic endophytic fungi, (3) attraction of entomophages and pollinators, (4) allelopathic effects that inhibit seed germination and soil bacteria, and (5) interaction with reactive troposphere gases. The results are integrated by discussing how these terpenoids may be contributing factors in determining some properties of terrestrial plant communities and ecosystems. A terrestrial phytocentric approach is necessitated due to the magnitude and scope of terpenoid interactions. This presentation has a more broadly based ecological perspective than the several excellent recent reviews of the ecological chemistry of terpenoids.},

	abstract = {Solidago altissima L. was introduced into Europe as an ornamental plant from North America more than 100 years ago and the phytophagous insect fauna of it was recently examined in Switzerland where it has become an important weed in disturbed habitats. Rhizomes and aerial parts were examined and all insects collected in summer were tested in a no-choice feeding test. 18 out of 55 phytophagous insects were found feeding on S. altissima in Switzerland and for the remaining 37 the relation with the plant was not determined. The insects that have expanded their host range to feed on S. altissima since its introduction to Switzerland are almost solely opportunistic, unspecialized ectophages not closely attuned to the growth cycle of S. altissima. Only 4\% of the insects were specialists and 9\% endophagous. In contrast in North America S. altissima supports 25\% specialists and 17\% endophages. The native Solidago virgaurea L. in Switzerland supports many more specialists (28\%) and endophages (23\%) than S. altissima here. Possible reasons why almost none of these have switched to S. altissima are discussed. A comparison is made between the number of insects recruited by S. altissima in Switzerland with the number recruited by the exotic plants Heracleum mantegazzianum Som. \& Lev. (Apiaceae) in Switzerland and Xanthium occidentale Bertol. (Asteraceae) in Australia. Reasons for different levels of insect recruitment are discussed. The high number of phytophagous insect species found on S. altissima in North America shows that there should be no shortage of possible control agents and any insects imported into Switzerland for the biological control of S. altissima would find largely unexploited food sources awaiting them.},

If trait differences are linked to differential demographic probabilities (i.e. fitness differences) then natural selection will constrain the average trait values found in the community and such average (‘community-aggregated’) traits will then possess information that is translated into the maximum entropy probabilities. If community assembly is strictly neutral then the maxent model will have no predictive ability. This also justifies the null model, and the permutation test, proposed by Roxburgh and Mokany.},

In this study, we aimed to explain the distribution of two annual alien Xanthium species ( X. occidentale and X. italicum ) found in the northern Kinki Distinct of Japan from the viewpoint of RI. First, specimen records demonstrated that Xanthium occidentale was more dominant in all habitats except seaside habitats. Subsequently, using artificial patches of potted plants, we demonstrated that X. italicum suffered intense RI from X. occidentale . Finally, X . italicum was superior to X . occidentale in tolerating salinity stress. Combining these results, we concluded that the asymmetrical RI caused by X . occidentale displaced X . italicum except in seaside habitats, where X . occidentale could not establish colonies. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility that a similar RI effect caused the extinction of native species.},

	abstract = {Understanding the forces that influence natural variation within and among populations has been a major objective of evolutionary biologists for decades. Motivated by the growth in computational power and data complexity, modern approaches to this question make intensive use of simulation methods. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is one of these methods. Here we review the foundations of ABC, its recent algorithmic developments, and its applications in evolutionary biology and ecology. We argue that the use of ABC should incorporate all aspects of Bayesian data analysis: formulation, fitting, and improvement of a model. ABC can be a powerful tool to make inferences with complex models if these principles are carefully applied.},

	abstract = {Intraspecific variation and genotypic diversity of host-plants can affect the structure of associated arthropod communities and the dynamics of populations. Similarly, neighboring plants can also affect interactions between host-plants and their associated arthropods. However, most studies on the effects of host-plant genotypes have largely ignored the potential effects of neighboring host-plants on arthropod communities. In this study, we used a common garden experiment to ask how spatial effects of neighboring patches , along with genotype identity and genotypic diversity in tall goldenrod ( Solidago altissima ), affect the abundances of a common goldenrod herbivore ( Uroleucon nigrotuberculatum ) and their dominant predator ( Harmonia axyridis, a ladybird beetle). Aphid abundance varied 80-fold among genotypes, while ladybird beetle abundance was not affected by genotype identity. Additionally, there were strong effects of neighboring plots: aphid abundance in a focal plot was positively correlated to aphid abundance in nearby plots, suggesting strong spatial patterning in the abundance of aphids. Neither aphid nor ladybird beetle abundance was affected by genotypic diversity. However, focal plot genotypic diversity mediated the strength of the neighborhood effect (i.e., strong effects for genotype polyculture focal plots and weak effects for genotype monoculture focal plots). Our results show that aphids were directly influenced by host-plant genotype identity while ladybird beetles responded mainly to prey abundance, and suggest that genotypic diversity can influence the effects of spatial processes on the plant-herbivore interactions.},

There are more than 200 GS species found in order Brassicales and presence of these compounds is well documented on organ-specific but not on cell-specific level. We used UPLC/ESI-QTOF-MS to measure the presence of GS and qRT-PCR to analyse the expression of GS biosynthetic and regulatory genes in isolated Arabidopsis thaliana trichomes. Trichomes of Arabidopsis are shown to synthesize chemoprotective aliphatic glucosinolates (AGS) and indolic glucosinolates (IGS), which are known for their biological activities against fungi, bacterial pathogens, or herbivores. UPLC/ESI-QTOF-MS analysis of various IGS mutants reveal increased or decreased levels of IGS in trichomes of gain- and loss-of-function mutants correspondingly. Using pMYB51/HIG1-uidA and pMYB28/PMG1/HAG1-uidA reporter plants we demonstrate that production of these important compounds is activated in trichomes of leaves or inflorescences in response to wounding. Since trichomes represent the first interface in plant-environment interactions, the possible role of GS containing trichomes in plant defense or signaling is discussed.},

Comparison of two commonly studied Arabidopsis ecotypes in choice experiments showed that Columbia is considerably more resistant than Landsberg erecta. In no-choice experiments, where larvae were confined on one or the other ecotype, weight gain was more rapid on Landsberg erectathan on Columbia. Genetic mapping of this difference in insect susceptibility using recombinant inbred lines resulted in the discovery of the TASTY locus near 85 cM on chromosome 1 of Arabidopsis. The resistant allele of this locus is in the Columbia ecotype, and an F1 hybrid has a sensitive phenotype that is similar to that of Landsberg erecta. TheTASTY locus is distinct from known genetic differences between Columbia and Landsberg erecta that affect glucosinolate content, trichome density, disease resistance, and flowering time.},

Analyses were performed on 508 individuals from 26 populations. All loci were polymorphic with six to 23 alleles per locus. Genetic diversity varied between 0.56 and 0.76. • Conclusions: Our results demonstrated the value of these eight microsatellite markers to investigate neutral population genetic structure in A. halleri.

	abstract = {The implications of transitioning to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) from microsatellite markers (MSs) have been investigated in a number of population genetics studies, but the effect of genomic location on the amount of information each type of marker reveals has not been explored in detail. We developed novel SNP markers flanking 1 kb regions of 13 genic (within gene or {\textbackslash}textless1 kb away from gene) and 13 nongenic ({\textbackslash}textgreater10 kb from annotated gene) MSs in the threespine stickleback genome to obtain comparable data for both types of markers. We analysed patterns of genetic diversity and divergence on various geographic scales after converting the SNP loci within each genomic region into haplotypes. Marker type (SNP haplotype or MS) and location (genic or nongenic) significantly affected most estimates of population diversity and divergence. Between-lineage divergence was significantly higher in SNP haplotypes (genic and nongenic), however, within-lineage divergence was similar between marker types. Most divergence and diversity measures were uncorrelated between markers, except for population differentiation which was correlated between MSs and SNP haplotypes (both genic and nongenic). Broad-scale population structure and assignment were similarly resolved by both marker types, however, only the MSs were able to delimit fine-scale population structuring, particularly when genic and nongenic markers were combined. These results demonstrate that estimates of genetic variability and differentiation among populations can be strongly influenced by marker type, their genomic location in relation to genes and by the interaction of these two factors. This highlights the importance of having an awareness of the inherent strengths and limitations associated with different molecular tools to select the most appropriate methods for accurately addressing various ecological and evolutionary questions.},

(Orthoptera: Acrididae). Two experiments were conducted, both with insects individually housed in arenas containing four dishes of chemically defined synthetic food. In one experiment two nutritionally imbalanced, but complementary, foods (high protein, low carbohydrate (P) and low protein, high carbohydrate (C)) were presented at different frequencies (4P:0C, 3P:1C, 2P:2C, 1P:3C and 0P:4C). The locusts regulated their feeding among the food dishes such that they defended their intake of both protein and carbohydrate, despite differences between treatments in the relative frequency of the two food types. In a second experiment, optimal (O) and suboptimal (either P or C) synthetic foods were paired in different relative frequencies. Despite the opportunity to ingest only optimal food, the locusts included suboptimal foods in their diet to varying degrees. However, they fed preferentially upon the optimal food when it was presented along with dishes of suboptimal food and they increased their fidelity to dishes of the optimal food as they decreased in frequency relative to dishes of suboptimal food. Patterns of consumption in both experiments were consistent with the control of food choices and intake being governed by a combination of known mechanisms, including direct metabolic feedback and learning.},

	abstract = {Gulf of Mexico blooms of the dinoflagellate Karenia brevis produce neurotoxic cyclic polyethers called brevetoxins. During and after a red tide bloom in southwestern Florida, K. brevis cells lyse and release brevetoxins, which then sink to the benthos and coat the surfaces of seagrasses and their epiphytes. We tested the possibility that these brevetoxin-laden foods alter the feeding behavior and fitness of a common benthic herbivore within Floridean seagrass beds, the amphipod Ampithoe longimana. We demonstrated that coating foods with K. brevis extracts that contain brevetoxins at post-bloom concentrations (1 μg g−1 drymass) does not alter the feeding rates of Florida nor North Carolina populations of A. longimana, although a slight deterrent effect was found at eight and ten-fold greater concentrations. During a series of feeding choice assays, A. longimana tended not to be deterred by foods coated with K. brevis extracts nor with the purified brevetoxins PbTx-2 and PbTx-3. Florida juveniles isolated with either extract-coated or control foods for 10 days did not differ in survivorship nor growth. A similar lack of feeding response to brevetoxin-laden foods also was exhibited by two other generalist herbivores of the southeastern United States, the amphipod A. valida and the urchin Arbacia punctulata. Given that benthic mesograzers constitute a significant portion of the diet for the juvenile stage of many nearshore fishes, we hypothesize that the ability of some mesograzers to feed on and retain brevetoxins in their bodies indicates that mesograzers may represent an important route of vertical transmission of brevetoxins through higher trophic levels within Gulf of Mexico estuaries.},

Here we show that the parallel phenotypic evolution is matched by parallel patterns of nucleotide diversity and population differentiation across the genome. We used a novel high-throughput sequence-based genotyping approach to produce the first high density genome-wide scans of threespine stickleback populations and identified several genomic regions indicative of both divergent and balancing selection. Some of these regions have been associated previously with traits important for freshwater adaptation, but others were previously unidentified. Within these genomic regions we identified candidate genes, laying the foundation for further genetic and functional study of key pathways.

	abstract = {Plants growing in dense stands of native vegetation are often less susceptible to herbivore attack than isolated plants or plants growing in monoculture. Three mechanisms have been suggested that may account for this phenomenon; (1) maintenance of a complex predator fauna in dense vegetation; (2) inhibition by complex vegetation of the ability of an herbivore to discover its host plants; and (3) decreased residence time of herbivores on plants growing in diverse vegetation. This study demonstrates that for both adults and larvae of the pipevine swallowtail butterfly, Battus philenor, inhibition of discovery is the primary cause of decreased susceptibility of its host plants, Aristolochia reticulata, to attack when grown amid native vegetation. In addition, this study demonstrates that a seasonal decrease in the susceptibility of host plants to discovery by adults is correlated with a seasonal increase in the height and density of the native vegetation. A similar inverse correlation between vegetation structure and susceptibility to discovery by larvae was detected. However, seasonal changes in vegetation structure do not influence susceptibility to larval discovery. This differential effect of changing vegetation structure on searching efficiency is probably due to differences in the way larvae and adults search.},

We modelled the observed spatial variation in seedling recruitment following Hurricane Georges as a function of the potential number of seedlings at a given location (based on local source trees and the potential contribution of parents from outside of the mapped area) and of light levels and density-dependent mortality during establishment. We adopted the model comparison paradigm and compared the performance of increasingly complex models against a null model that assumes uniform seedling distribution across the plot. * 2Our data supported a model in which parents must reach a threshold size before any seedling production will occur. Once parents attain that size, the relationship between tree diameter and the number of seedlings produced is fairly flat for the majority of species. These results contradict previous analyses that simply assumed a linear relationship between biomass and seedling production and a uniform size threshold for seedling production across species. * 3The majority of species tested supported models that included at least one of a bath term (contribution from non-local trees), conspecific density dependence and light availability after the hurricane. Density dependence shifted the mode of the effective dispersal kernel away from potential parent trees and significantly reduced the number of seedlings established near parent trees. Recruitment from non-local sources accounted for 6–81\% of observed seedling recruitment depending upon the tree species. Light availability appeared to divide species into three groups that showed more successful seedling establishment at low ({\textbackslash}textless 5\% of full sun), intermediate or high light levels ({\textbackslash}textgreater 30\% full sun). * 4Differences between individual species in the importance of local vs. bath recruitment and the intensity of density dependence suggest the existence of distinct recruitment syndromes that go beyond the traditional focus of tropical tree life histories. Understanding these syndromes will provide valuable insights into the spatial distribution of tropical tree species and the maintenance of tropical forest diversity.},

Although HIPVs are known to enhance plant resistance by affecting herbivore host plant preferences and by attracting natural enemies, little is known about the role of HIPVs on the resistance of neighbouring plants and the mechanism behind this associational resistance. * This study examined the effect of HIPVs from herbivore-damaged host plants (alfalfa (Medicago sativa), clover (Trifolium alexandrinum) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum)) on oviposition by Egyptian cotton leafworm (Spodoptera littoralis) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) on neighbouring, undamaged host plants. * There was a significant reduction in oviposition by S. littoralis on undamaged plants adjacent to herbivore-damaged cotton plants under both field and laboratory conditions. The results showed that the associational resistance by HIPVs depends on direct effects on oviposition behaviour in S. littoralis. There were also indications that other mechanisms may be involved. * Associational resistance via HIPVs was not observed for all plant species tested. Emission of HIPVs from damaged cotton increased the resistance of undamaged cotton and alfalfa plants to oviposition by S. littoralis, but HIPVs from damaged alfalfa and clover neighbours did not provide resistance to undamaged cotton plants. * Synthesis. Our results suggest that the presence of HIPV-emitting plant neighbours can reduce herbivory on undamaged plants and enhance plant resistance by affecting oviposition behaviour in insect herbivores.},

The underlying mechanism was examined in order to evaluate connections between mechanisms and species specificity. * 3Laboratory studies showed that N. marmoratus but not Galerucella individuals were attracted by odour from undamaged host plants, and that neither species was distracted by odour from Myrica gale. * 4Field experiments showed that three non-host plant neighbours with an appearance similar to M. gale, and artificial shrubs, reduced the abundance and egg-laying of Galerucella species by 70–90\%. The abundance of N. marmoratus was increased 18-fold on plants in thickets compared with outside. * 5. The different responses by N. marmoratus and the Galerucella species to plant neighbours appear to be because N. marmoratus, but not Galerucella, uses olfactory information in the initial host-finding process.},

	abstract = {Mimicry and warning color are highly paradoxical adaptations. Color patterns in both Müllerian and Batesian mimicry are often determined by relatively few pattern-regulating loci with major effects. Many of these loci are "supergenes," consisting of multiple, tightly linked epistatic elements. On the one hand, strong purifying selection on these genes must explain accurate resemblance (a reduction of morphological diversity between species), as well as monomorphic color patterns within species. On the other hand, mimicry has diversified at every taxonomic level; warning color has evolved from cryptic patterns, and there are mimetic polymorphisms within species, multiple color patterns in different geographic races of the same species, mimetic differences between sister species, and multiple mimicry rings within local communities. These contrasting patterns can be explained, in part, by the shape of a "number-dependent" selection function first modeled by Fritz Muller in 1879: Purifying selection against any warning-colored morph is very strong when that morph is rare, but becomes weak in a broad basin of intermediate frequencies, allowing opportunities for polymorphisms and genetic drift. This Mullerian explanation, however, makes unstated assumptions about predator learning and forgetting which have recently been challenged. Today's "receiver psychology" models predict that classical Mullerian mimicry could be much rarer than believed previously, and that "quasi-Batesian mimicry," a new type of mimicry intermediate between Mullerian and Batesian, could be common. However, the new receiver psychology theory is untested, and indeed it seems to us unlikely; alternative assumptions could easily lead to a more traditional Mullerian/Batesian mimicry divide.},

	abstract = {The tropical rocky shore crab Grapsus albolineatus selectively consumes rare filamentous algae over more abundant foliose algae during the winter in Hong Kong. Laboratory experiments have shown that growth of G. albolineatus is enhanced and mortality reduced when given a diet of filamentous algae as opposed to foliose algae. In the laboratory, G. albolineatus consumed filamentous algae (Enteromorpha clathrata, Hincksia mitchelliae and Chaetomorpha antennina) in greater amounts than any foliose algae (Dermonema frappieri, Pterocladia tenuis, Porphyra suborbiculata, Ulva fasciata, Endarachne binghamiae) in both multiple choice and no choice experiments. The most energy-rich alga was Pterocladia, while Porphyra had the highest protein content. Filamentous algae had lower overall nutrient contents than foliose algae. Consumption rates for Enteromorpha and Hincksia were, however, sufficiently higher than for Porphyra, which ensured that the net intake of nutrients per day was greater. Even though protein assimilation efficiency was higher for Porphyra than Hincksia,G. albolineatus assimilated more protein, per day, from Hincksia. When the confounding effects of morphology and nutrient value were separated, by offering the crab choices of commercially available algae (Laminaria sp.) cut into different forms (foliose and filamentous), G. albolineatus showed a strong preference for the filamentous form, despite both forms having the same nutrient value. Preference for filamentous forms is likely to be constrained by the morphology of the chelae, which have delicate tips, and appear unable to tear foliose algae. Algal morphology, therefore, appears to be of prime importance and the nutrient content and digestibility of algae of secondary importance in determining the feeding preferences of G. albolineatus. The high consumption rate of filamentous algae outweighs their relative nutrient deficiencies, indicating that they are better suited to meeting the physiological needs of the crab than foliose algae.},

	issn = {0016-6731},
	abstract = {Trichome development in Arabidopsis thaliana is a well-characterized model for the study of plant cell differentiation. Two genes that play an essential role in the initiation of trichome development are GL1 and TTG. Mutations in either gene prevent the initiation of most trichomes. The GL1 gene encodes a myb-related transcription factor. Mutations in TTG are pleiotropic, affecting anthocyanins, root hairs, and seed coat mucilage in addition to trichomes. Six ttg alleles were examined and shown to form a hypomorphic series. The severity of all aspects of the ttg phenotype varied in parallel in this allelic series. The weakest allele, ttg-10, causes frequent clusters of adjacent trichomes, suggesting a role for TTG in inhibiting neighboring cells from choosing the trichome fate. This allele results from a mutation in the 5'-untranslated region of ttg and creates an out-of-frame upstream AUG codon. The ttg-10 allele shows several unusual genetic interactions with the weak hypomorphic gl1-2 allele, including intergenic noncomplementation and a synthetic glabrous phenotype. These interactions are specific for the gl1-2 allele. The implication of these results for current models of trichome development is discussed.},

	volume = {161},
	issn = {0016-6731},
	abstract = {The ability of a single genotype to generate different phenotypes in disparate environments is termed phenotypic plasticity, which reflects the interaction of genotype and environment on developmental processes. However, there is controversy over the definition of plasticity genes. The gene regulation model states that plasticity loci influence trait changes between environments without altering the means within a given environment. Alternatively, the allelic sensitivity model argues that plasticity evolves due to selection of phenotypic values expressed within particular environments; hence plasticity must be controlled by loci expressed within these environments. To identify genetic loci controlling phenotypic plasticity and address this controversy, we analyzed the plasticity of glucosinolate accumulation under methyl jasmonate (MeJa) treatment in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found genetic variation influencing multiple MeJa signal transduction pathways. Analysis of MeJa responses in the Landsberg erecta x Columbia recombinant inbred lines identified a number of quantitative trait loci (QTL) that regulate plastic MeJa responses. All significant plasticity QTL also impacted the mean trait value in at least one of the two "control" or "MeJa" environments, supporting the allelic sensitivity model. Additionally, we present an analysis of MeJa and salicylic acid cross-talk in glucosinolate regulation and describe the implications for glucosinolate physiology and functional understanding of Arabidopsis MeJa signal transduction.},

	abstract = {The interval mapping method is widely used for the mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in segregating generations derived from crosses between inbred lines. The efficiency of detecting and the accuracy of mapping multiple QTLs by using genetic markers are much increased by employing multiple QTL models instead of the single QTL models (and no QTL models) used in interval mapping. However, the computational work involved with multiple QTL models is considerable when the number of QTLs is large. In this paper it is proposed to combine multiple linear regression methods with conventional interval mapping. This is achieved by fitting one QTL at a time in a given interval and simultaneously using (part of) the markers as cofactors to eliminate the effects of additional QTLs. It is shown that the proposed method combines the easy computation of the single QTL interval mapping method with much of the efficiency and accuracy of multiple QTL models.},

The successful integration of different fields of research in the study of A. thaliana has made a large contribution to our molecular understanding of key concepts in biology. The availability and active development of experimental tools and resources, in combination with the accessibility of a wealth of cumulatively acquired knowledge about this plant, support the most advanced systems biology approaches among all land plants. Research in molecular ecology and evolution has also brought the natural history of A. thaliana into the limelight. This article showcases our current knowledge of the natural history of A. thaliana from the perspective of the most closely related plant species, providing an evolutionary framework for interpreting novel findings and for developing new hypotheses based on our knowledge of this plant.},

	abstract = {We describe a general statistical framework for the genetic analysis of quantitative trait data in inbred line crosses. Our main result is based on the observation that, by conditioning on the unobserved QTL genotypes, the problem can be split into two statistically independent and manageable parts. The first part involves only the relationship between the QTL and the phenotype. The second part involves only the location of the QTL in the genome. We developed a simple Monte Carlo algorithm to implement Bayesian QTL analysis. This algorithm simulates multiple versions of complete genotype information on a genomewide grid of locations using information in the marker genotype data. Weights are assigned to the simulated genotypes to capture information in the phenotype data. The weighted complete genotypes are used to approximate quantities needed for statistical inference of QTL locations and effect sizes. One advantage of this approach is that only the weights are recomputed as the analyst considers different candidate models. This device allows the analyst to focus on modeling and model comparisons. The proposed framework can accommodate multiple interacting QTL, nonnormal and multivariate phenotypes, covariates, missing genotype data, and genotyping errors in any type of inbred line cross. A software tool implementing this procedure is available. We demonstrate our approach to QTL analysis using data from a mouse backcross population that is segregating multiple interacting QTL associated with salt-induced hypertension.},

To quantify evidence for key features of plant community structure, I recharacterized published data from interaction experiments as networks of competitive and facilitative interactions. I measured the network structure of 31 woody and herbaceous communities, including the intensity, distribution, and diversity of interactions at the species-pair and community levels to determine the generality of competition, winner-loser relationships, and unequal interaction allocation. I developed novel methodology using meta-analysis to incorporate interaction uncertainty into estimates of structural metrics among independent networks. Plant communities were competitive, but intraspecific interactions were sometimes more intense than interspecific interactions. On the whole, interactions were imbalanced and communities were transitive. However, facilitation, balanced interactions, and intransitivity were common in individual communities. Synthesizing network metrics using meta-analysis is an original approach with which to generalize community structure in a systematic way.},

To understand the complex inheritance of resistance to the powdery mildew disease in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, quantitative trait loci analysis was performed using a set of recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between the resistant accession Kashmir-1 and the susceptible accession Columbia glabrous1. We identified and mapped three independent powdery mildew quantitative disease resistance loci, which act additively to confer disease resistance. The locus with the strongest effect on resistance was mapped to a 500-kbp interval on chromosome III.},

	abstract = {The advent of complete genetic linkage maps consisting of codominant DNA markers [typically restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs)] has stimulated interest in the systematic genetic dissection of discrete Mendelian factors underlying quantitative traits in experimental organisms. We describe here a set of analytical methods that modify and extend the classical theory for mapping such quantitative trait loci (QTLs). These include: (i) a method of identifying promising crosses for QTL mapping by exploiting a classical formula of SEWALL WRIGHT; (ii) a method (interval mapping) for exploiting the full power of RFLP linkage maps by adapting the approach of LOD score analysis used in human genetics, to obtain accurate estimates of the genetic location and phenotypic effect of QTLs; and (iii) a method (selective genotyping) that allows a substantial reduction in the number of progeny that need to be scored with the DNA markers. In addition to the exposition of the methods, explicit graphs are provided that allow experimental geneticists to estimate, in any particular case, the number of progeny required to map QTLs underlying a quantitative trait.},

	abstract = {Selection in which fitnesses vary with the changing genetic composition of the population may facilitate the maintenance of genetic diversity in a wide range of organisms. Here, a detailed theoretical investigation is made of a frequency-dependent selection model, in which fitnesses are based on pairwise interactions between the two phenotypes at a diploid, diallelic, autosomal locus with complete dominance. The allele frequency dynamics are fully delimited analytically, along with all possible shapes of the mean fitness function in terms of where it increases or decreases as a function of the current allele frequency in the population. These results in turn allow possibly the first complete characterization of the dynamical behavior by the mean fitness through time under frequency-dependent selection. Here the mean fitness (i) monotonically increases, (ii) monotonically decreases, (iii) initially increases and then decreases, or (iv) initially decreases and then increases as equilibrium is approached. We analytically derive the exact initial and fitness conditions that produce each dynamic and how often each arises. Computer simulations with random initial conditions and fitnesses reveal that the potential decline in mean fitness is not negligible; on average a net decrease occurs 20\% of the time and reduces the mean fitness by {\textbackslash}textgreater17\%.},

	shorttitle = {Frequency-dependent selection},
	abstract = {A detailed analytic and numerical study is made of the potential for permanent genetic variation in frequency-dependent models based on pairwise interactions among genotypes at a single diallelic locus. The full equilibrium structure and qualitative gene-frequency dynamics are derived analytically for a symmetric model, in which pairwise fitnesses are chiefly determined by the genetic similarity of the individuals involved. This is supplemented by an extensive numerical investigation of the general model, the symmetric model, and nine other special cases. Together the results show that there is a high potential for permanent genetic diversity in the pairwise interaction model, and provide insight into the extent to which various forms of genotypic interactions enhance or reduce this potential. Technically, although two stable polymorphic equilibria are possible, the increased likelihood of maintaining both alleles, and the poor performance of protected polymorphism conditions as a measure of this likelihood, are primarily due to a greater variety and frequency of equilibrium patterns with one stable polymorphic equilibrium, in conjunction with a disproportionately large domain of attraction for stable internal equilibria.},

	abstract = {We consider a model of frequency-dependent selection, which we refer to as the Wildcard Model. A variety of more specific models, representing quite diverse biological situations, are covered by the Wildcard Model as particular cases. Two very different particular models that are subsumed by the Wildcard Model are the game theoretically motivated two-phenotype model of Lessard [Lessard, S.,1984. Evolutionary dynamics in frequency-dependent two-phenotype models, Theor. Popul. Biol. 25, 210–234], and the model of selection on a continuous trait due to intraspecific competition of Bürger [Bürger, R., 2005. A multilocus analysis of intraspecific competition and stabilizing selection on a quantitative trait. J. Math. Biol. 50 (4), 355–396] and Schneider [Schneider, K.A., 2006. A multilocus-multiallele analysis of frequency-dependent selection induced by intraspecific competition. J. Math. Biol. 52 (4), 483–523]. Both these models have been shown in the past to have a global Lyapunov function (LF) under appropriate genetic assumptions. We show that (i) the Wildcard Model in continuous time for a single multiallelic locus, or for multiple multiallelic loci in linkage equilibrium, has a global LF, of which the Lessard and Bürger–Scheneider LF are special cases in spite of their widely different biological interpretations; (ii) the LF of the Wildcard Model can be derived from an LF previously identified for a model of densityand frequency-dependent selection due to Lotka–Volterra competition, with one locus, multiple alleles, multiple species and continuous-time dynamics [Matessi, C., Jayakar, S.D., 1981. Coevolution of species in competition: A theoretical study. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 78 (2, part2), 1081–1084]. We extend the LF with density and frequency dependence to the multilocus case with linkage-equilibrium dynamics. As a possible application of our results, the optimization principle we established can be used as a tool in the study of long-term evolution of various models subsumed by the Wildcard Model based on explicit short-term dynamics.},

Two opposing evolutionary forces are assumed to act: (i) stabilizing selection on the trait, which favors genotypes with an intermediate phenotype, and (ii) intraspeciﬁc competition mediated by that trait, which favors genotypes whose effect on the trait deviates most from that of the prevailing genotypes. Accordingly, ﬁtnesses of genotypes have a frequency-independent component describing stabilizing selection and a frequency- and density-dependent component modeling competition. We study how the equilibrium structure, in particular, number, degree of polymorphism, and genetic variance of stable equilibria, is affected by the strength of frequency dependence, and what role the number of loci, the amount of recombination, and the demographic parameters play. To this end, we employ a statistical and numerical approach, complemented by analytical results, and explore how the equilibrium properties averaged over a large number of genetic systems with a given number of loci and average amount of recombination depend on the ecological and demographic parameters. We identify two parameter regions with a transitory region in between, in which the equilibrium properties of genetic systems are distinctively different. These regions depend on the strength of frequency dependence relative to pure stabilizing selection and on the demographic parameters, but not on the number of loci or the amount of recombination. We further study the shape of the ﬁtness function observed at equilibrium and the extent to which the dynamics in this model are adaptive, and we present examples of equilibrium distributions of genotypic values under strong frequency dependence. Consequences for the maintenance of genetic variation, the detection of disruptive selection, and models of sympatric speciation are discussed.},

	abstract = {A genetic model is investigated in which two recombining loci determine the genotypic value of a quantitative trait additively. Two opposing evolutionary forces are assumed to act: stabilizing selection on the trait, which favors genotypes with an intermediate phenotype, and intraspeciﬁc competition mediated by that trait, which favors genotypes whose effect on the trait deviates most from that of the prevailing genotypes. Accordingly, ﬁtnesses of genotypes have a frequency-independent component describing stabilizing selection and a frequency- and density-dependent component modeling competition. We study how the underlying genetics, in particular recombination rate and relative magnitude of allelic effects, interact with the conﬂicting selective forces and derive the resulting, surprisingly complex equilibrium patterns. We also investigate the conditions under which disruptive selection on the phenotypes can be observed and examine how much genetic variation can be maintained in such a model. We discovered a number of unexpected phenomena. For instance, we found that with little recombination the degree of stably maintained polymorphism and the equilibrium genetic variance can decrease as the strength of competition increases relative to the strength of stabilizing selection. In addition, we found that mean ﬁtness at the stable equilibria is usually much lower than the maximum possible mean ﬁtness and often even lower than the ﬁtness at other, unstable equilibria. Thus, the evolutionary dynamics in this system are almost always nonadaptive.},

	abstract = {The equilibrium structure of an additive, diallelic multilocus model of a quantitative trait under frequency- and density-dependent selection is derived. The trait is under stabilizing selection and mediates intraspeciﬁc competition as induced, for instance, by differential resource utilization. It is assumed that stabilizing selection is weak, but the strength of competition may be arbitrary relative to it. Density dependence is caused by population regulation, which may be of a very general kind. The number and effects of loci are arbitrary, and stabilizing selection is not necessarily symmetric with respect to the range of phenotypic values. All previously studied models of intraspeciﬁc competition for a continuum of resources known to the author reduce to a special case of the present model if overall selection is weak. Therefore, in this case our results are applicable as approximations to all these models. Our central result is the (nearly) complete characterization of the equilibrium and stability structure in terms of all parameters. It is derived under the sole assumption that selection is weak enough relative to recombination to ignore linkage disequilibrium. In particular, necessary and sufﬁcient conditions on the strength of competition relative to stabilizing selection are found that ensure the maintenance of multilocus polymorphism and the occurrence of disruptive selection. In this case, explicit formulas for the number of polymorphic loci at equilibrium, the allele frequencies, the genetic variance, and the strength of disruptive selection are obtained. For two loci, the effects of linkage are investigated analytically; for several loci, they are studied numerically.},

	volume = {152},
	issn = {0016-6731},
	abstract = {Stabilizing selection for an intermediate optimum is generally considered to deplete genetic variation in quantitative traits. However, conflicting results from various types of models have been obtained. While classical analyses assuming a large number of independent additive loci with individually small effects indicated that no genetic variation is preserved under stabilizing selection, several analyses of two-locus models showed the contrary. We perform a complete analysis of a generalization of Wright's two-locus quadratic-optimum model and investigate numerically the ability of quadratic stabilizing selection to maintain genetic variation in additive quantitative traits controlled by up to five loci. A statistical approach is employed by choosing randomly 4000 parameter sets (allelic effects, recombination rates, and strength of selection) for a given number of loci. For each parameter set we iterate the recursion equations that describe the dynamics of gamete frequencies starting from 20 randomly chosen initial conditions until an equilibrium is reached, record the quantities of interest, and calculate their corresponding mean values. As the number of loci increases from two to five, the fraction of the genome expected to be polymorphic declines surprisingly rapidly, and the loci that are polymorphic increasingly are those with small effects on the trait. As a result, the genetic variance expected to be maintained under stabilizing selection decreases very rapidly with increased number of loci. The equilibrium structure expected under stabilizing selection on an additive trait differs markedly from that expected under selection with no constraints on genotypic fitness values. The expected genetic variance, the expected polymorphic fraction of the genome, as well as other quantities of interest, are only weakly dependent on the selection intensity and the level of recombination.},

	abstract = {There are numerous biological examples where genes associated with migratory ability of cells also confer the cells with an increased ﬁtness even though these genes may not have any known effect on the cell mitosis rates. Here, we provide insight into these observations by analyzing the effects of cell migration, compression, and contact inhibition on the growth of tumor cell clusters using the Cellular Potts Model (CPM) in a monolayer geometry. This is a follow-up of a previous study (Thalhauser et al. 2010) in which a Moran-type model was used to study the interaction of cell proliferation, migratory potential and death on the emergence of invasive phenotypes. Here, we extend the study to include the effects of cell size and shape. In particular, we investigate the interplay between cell motility and compressibility within the CPM and ﬁnd that the CPM predicts that increased cell motility leads to smaller cells. This is an artifact in the CPM. An analysis of the CPM reveals an explicit inverse-relationship between the cell stiffness and motility parameters. We use this relationship to compensate for motilityinduced changes in cell size in the CPM so that in the corrected CPM, cell size is independent of the cell motility. We ﬁnd that subject to comparable levels of compression, clusters of motile cells grow faster than clusters of less motile cells, in qualitative agreement with biological observations and our previous study. Increasing compression tends to reduce growth rates. Contact inhibition penalizes clumped cells by halting their growth and gives motile cells an even greater advantage. Finally, our model predicts cell size distributions that are consistent with those observed in clusters of neuroblastoma cells cultured in low and high density conditions.},

We analyze essentially all models for multilocus epistasis that have been numerically simulated to demonstrate increased additive variance. We conclude that for biologically plausible models, large increases in expected additive variance—attributable to epistasis rather than dominance—are unlikely. Naciri-Graven and Goudet (2003) found that as the number of epistatically interacting loci increases, additive variance tends to be inﬂated more after a bottleneck. We argue that this result reﬂects biologically unrealistic aspects of their models. Speciﬁcally, as the number of loci increases, higher-order epistatic interactions become increasingly important in these models, with an increasing fraction of the genetic variance becoming nonadditive, contrary to empirical observations. As shown by Barton and Turelli (2004), without dominance, conversion of nonadditive to additive variance depends only on the variance components and not on the number of loci per se. Numerical results indicating that more inbreeding is needed to produce maximal release of additive variance with more loci follow directly from our analytical results, which show that high levels of inbreeding (F Ͼ 0.5) are needed for signiﬁcant conversion of higher-order components. We discuss alternative approaches to modeling multilocus epistasis and understanding its consequences.},

	abstract = {We investigate three alternative selection-based scenarios proposed to maintain polygenic variation: pleiotropic balancing selection, G ϫ E interactions (with spatial or temporal variation in allelic effects), and sex-dependent allelic effects. Each analysis assumes an additive polygenic trait with n diallelic loci under stabilizing selection. We allow loci to have different effects and consider equilibria at which the population mean departs from the stabilizing-selection optimum. Under weak selection, each model produces essentially identical, approximate allele-frequency dynamics. Variation is maintained under pleiotropic balancing selection only at loci for which the strength of balancing selection exceeds the effective strength of stabilizing selection. In addition, for all models, polymorphism requires that the population mean be close enough to the optimum that directional selection does not overwhelm balancing selection. This balance allows many simultaneously stable equilibria, and we explore their properties numerically. Both spatial and temporal G ϫ E can maintain variation at loci for which the coefﬁcient of variation (across environments) of the effect of a substitution exceeds a critical value greater than one. The critical value depends on the correlation between substitution effects at different loci. For large positive correlations (e.g., ␳2ij Ͼ 3/4), even extreme ﬂuctuations in allelic effects cannot maintain variation. Surprisingly, this constraint on correlations implies that sex-dependent allelic effects cannot maintain polygenic variation. We present numerical results that support our analytical approximations and discuss our results in connection to relevant data and alternative variance-maintaining mechanisms.},

Using ideas from game theory, we show that a monomorphism is a global attractor if one of its alleles dominates all other alleles at its locus. Further, we show that no isolated equilibrium exists, at which an unequal number of alleles from two loci is present. Under the assumption of convergence of trajectories to equilibrium points, we resolve the two-locus three-allele case for a fitness scheme formally equivalent to the classical symmetric viability model. We also provide an alternative proof for the two-locus two-allele case.},

Moreover, all the disequilibria of all orders vary approximately as the inverse of the probability of at least one recombination event among the loci involved. Finally, higher order disequilibria among loci will be lower than lower order ones, even if the level of epistasis is the same a t all orders. In this sense, the unit of selection is small. However, given the larger number of higher order disequilibria, these higher order disequilibria may play an important role in the computation of gametic frequencies from allelic frequencies in models with a large number of loci.

Although these reports come from a wide range of insect taxa and regions, the evidence to assess the extent of the phenomenon is sparse. Insect populations are challenging to study, and most monitoring methods are labor intensive and inefficient. Advances in computer vision and deep learning provide potential new solutions to this global challenge. Cameras and other sensors can effectively, continuously, and noninvasively perform entomological observations throughout diurnal and seasonal cycles. The physical appearance of specimens can also be captured by automated imaging in the laboratory. When trained on these data, deep learning models can provide estimates of insect abundance, biomass, and diversity. Further, deep learning models can quantify variation in phenotypic traits, behavior, and interactions. Here, we connect recent developments in deep learning and computer vision to the urgent demand for more cost-efficient monitoring of insects and other invertebrates. We present examples of sensor-based monitoring of insects. We show how deep learning tools can be applied to exceptionally large datasets to derive ecological information and discuss the challenges that lie ahead for the implementation of such solutions in entomology. We identify four focal areas, which will facilitate this transformation: 1) validation of image-based taxonomic identification; 2) generation of sufficient training data; 3) development of public, curated reference databases; and 4) solutions to integrate deep learning and molecular tools.},

	abstract = {Rapid and reliable identiﬁcation of insects is important in many contexts, from the detection of disease vectors and invasive species to the sorting of material from biodiversity inventories. Because of the shortage of adequate expertise, there has long been an interest in developing automated systems for this task. Previous attempts have been based on laborious and complex handcrafted extraction of image features, but in recent years it has been shown that sophisticated convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can learn to extract relevant features automatically, without human intervention. Unfortunately, reaching expert-level accuracy in CNN identiﬁcations requires substantial computational power and huge training data sets, which are often not available for taxonomic tasks. This can be addressed using feature transfer: a CNN that has been pretrained on a generic image classiﬁcation task is exposed to the taxonomic images of interest, and information about its perception of those images is used in training a simpler, dedicated identiﬁcation system. Here, we develop an effective method of CNN feature transfer, which achieves expert-level accuracy in taxonomic identiﬁcation of insects with training sets of 100 images or less per category, depending on the nature of data set. Speciﬁcally, we extract rich representations of intermediate to high-level image features from the CNN architecture VGG16 pretrained on the ImageNet data set. This information is submitted to a linear support vector machine classiﬁer, which is trained on the target problem. We tested the performance of our approach on two types of challenging taxonomic tasks: 1) identifying insects to higher groups when they are likely to belong to subgroups that have not been seen previously and 2) identifying visually similar species that are difﬁcult to separate even for experts. For the ﬁrst task, our approach reached {\textgreater}92\% accuracy on one data set (884 face images of 11 families of Diptera, all specimens representing unique species), and {\textgreater}96\% accuracy on another (2936 dorsal habitus images of 14 families of Coleoptera, over 90\% of specimens belonging to unique species). For the second task, our approach outperformed a leading taxonomic expert on one data set (339 images of three species of the Coleoptera genus Oxythyrea; 97\% accuracy), and both humans and traditional automated identiﬁcation systems on another data set (3845 images of nine species of Plecoptera larvae; 98.6 \% accuracy). Reanalyzing several biological image identiﬁcation tasks studied in the recent literature, we show that our approach is broadly applicable and provides signiﬁcant improvements over previous methods, whether based on dedicated CNNs, CNN feature transfer, or more traditional techniques. Thus, our method, which is easy to apply, can be highly successful in developing automated taxonomic identiﬁcation systems even when training data sets are small and computational budgets limited. We conclude by brieﬂy discussing some promising CNNbased research directions in morphological systematics opened up by the success of these techniques in providing accurate diagnostic tools.},

              Worldwide, farmers use insecticides to prevent crop damage caused by insect pests, while they also rely on insect pollinators to enhance crop yield and other insect as natural enemies of pests. In order to target pesticides to pests only, farmers must know exactly where and when pests and beneficial insects are present in the field. A promising solution to this problem could be optical sensors combined with machine learning. We obtained around 10,000 records of flying insects found in oilseed rape (
              Brassica napus
              ) crops, using an optical remote sensor and evaluated three different classification methods for the obtained signals, reaching over 80\% accuracy. We demonstrate that it is possible to classify insects in flight, making it possible to optimize the application of insecticides in space and time. This will enable a technological leap in precision agriculture, where focus on prudent and environmentally-sensitive use of pesticides is a top priority.},

	abstract = {Integrated pest management relies on insect pest monitoring to support the decision of counteracting a given level of infestation and to select the adequate control method. The classic monitoring approach of insect pests is based on placing in single infested areas a series of traps that are checked by human operators on a temporal basis. This strategy requires high labor cost and provides poor spatial and temporal resolution achievable by single operators. The adoption of image sensors to monitor insect pests can result in several practical advantages. The purpose of this review is to summarize the progress made on automatic traps with a particular focus on camera-equipped traps. The use of software and image recognition algorithms can support automatic trap usage to identify and/or count insect species from pictures. Considering the high image resolution achievable and the opportunity to exploit data transfer systems through wireless technology, it is possible to have remote control of insect captures, limiting field visits. The availability of real-time and on-line pest monitoring systems from a distant location opens the opportunity for measuring insect population dynamics constantly and simultaneously in a large number of traps with a limited human labor requirement. The actual limitations are the high cost, the low power autonomy and the low picture quality of some prototypes together with the need for further improvements in fully automated pest detection. Limits and benefits resulting from several case studies are examined with a perspective for the future development of technology-driven insect pest monitoring and management.},

            Image-based automatic classification of vector mosquitoes has been investigated for decades for its practical applications such as early detection of potential mosquitoes-borne diseases. However, the classification accuracy of previous approaches has never been close to human experts’ and often images of mosquitoes with certain postures and body parts, such as flatbed wings, are required to achieve good classification performance. Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are state-of-the-art approach to extracting visual features and classifying objects, and, hence, there exists great interest in applying DCNNs for the classification of vector mosquitoes from easy-to-acquire images. In this study, we investigated the capability of state-of-the-art deep learning models in classifying mosquito species having high inter-species similarity and intra-species variations. Since no off-the-shelf dataset was available capturing the variability of typical field-captured mosquitoes, we constructed a dataset with about 3,600 images of 8 mosquito species with various postures and deformation conditions. To further address data scarcity problems, we investigated the feasibility of transferring general features learned from generic dataset to the mosquito classification. Our result demonstrated that more than 97\% classification accuracy can be achieved by fine-tuning general features if proper data augmentation techniques are applied together. Further, we analyzed how this high classification accuracy can be achieved by visualizing discriminative regions used by deep learning models. Our results showed that deep learning models exploit morphological features similar to those used by human experts.},

In this paper, we propose an automated butterﬂy species identiﬁcation model using deep neural networks. We collected 44,659 images of 104 different butterﬂy species taken with different positions of butterﬂies, the shooting angle, butterﬂy distance, occlusion and background complexity in the ﬁeld in Turkey. Since many species have a few image samples we constructed a ﬁeld-based dataset of 17,769 butterﬂies with 10 species. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were used for the identiﬁcation of butterﬂy species. Comparison and evaluation of the experimental results obtained using three different network structures are conducted. Experimental results on 10 common butterﬂy species showed that our method successfully identiﬁed various butterﬂy species.},

              piece explores the issues encountered in designing human–machine systems optimized for both efficiency and volunteer engagement, while striving to safeguard and encourage opportunities for serendipitous discovery. We discuss case studies from Zooniverse, a large online citizen science platform, and show that combining human and machine classifications can efficiently produce results superior to those of either one alone and how smart task allocation can lead to further efficiencies in the system. While these examples make clear the promise of human–machine integration within an online citizen science system, we then explore in detail how system design choices can inadvertently lower volunteer engagement, create exclusionary practices, and reduce opportunity for serendipitous discovery. Throughout we investigate the tensions that arise when designing a human–machine system serving the dual goals of carrying out research in the most efficient manner possible while empowering a broad community to authentically engage in this research.},

	abstract = {New methodologies based on photonic sensors to survey flying insect populations in their natural habitat have gained traction over the last decade. Instruments such as entomological lidars, radars, or standoff sensors using active or passive light sources can observe large numbers of insects transiting through their field of view. While counting transits can inform on the relative change in insect population, it does not inform on the absolute population size, nor allows data from different instruments to be compared with one another. We propose a methodology to convert transit counts into an absolute insect population density, expressed in number of flying insects per meter cube. The latter benefits from being independent from the instrument and experiment char­ acteristics, making it an ideal metric to compare data originating from different sources. Due to the stochastic nature of the process, the uncertainty of the retrieved population density varies with its temporal resolution, the volume of air probed by the instrument and the population density itself. To study these complex relationships, a numerical model simulating the interactions of insects with a photonic sensor is presented. Finally, we offer an empirical solution to describe the relationship between the population density temporal resolution and its uncertainty.},

Instead of classical machine learning methods, in which manual feature extraction should be flawless to achieve successful results, there is a need for a model that does not need pre-processing and can perform a successful classification. In this study, EfficientNet deep learning architecture was proposed in plant leaf disease classification and the performance of this model was compared with other state-of-the-art deep learning models. The PlantVillage dataset was used to train models. All the models were trained with original and augmented datasets having 55,448 and 61,486 images, respectively.

Negative attitudes towards insects manifest as the emotion disgust, which is regarded as a psychological adaptation to produce pathogen-avoidance behavior. Based on theories of evolutionary psychology (parasite avoidance theory of disgust and error management theory), we hypothesized that there are two pathways by which urbanization increases the intensity and breadth of feelings of disgust towards insects: (1) urbanization increases the extent to which people see insects indoors, and insects that are seen more often indoors induce stronger feelings of disgust than is induced by insects seen outdoors; and (2) urbanization reduces people's natural history knowledge about insects, and decreased knowledge results in a broader range of insects eliciting feelings of disgust. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a large-scale online questionnaire survey and questionnaire experiment (n = 13,000) across Japan to quantify the association between the level of urbanization, places of insect sightings (outdoor/ indoor), knowledge about insects, and respondents' feelings of disgust. Our results supported both hypothetical pathway and suggested that psychological mechanisms shaped by past evolutionary pressure to avoid pathogen infection may underlie the current prevalence of insect disgust, and this is being reinforced by urbanization. Because negative perceptions of nature can reduce motivation for its conservation, negative attitudes towards insects exacerbated by ongoing urbanization is a potential global risk for biodiversity.},

              Sexual selection drives rapid phenotypic diversification of mating traits. However, we know little about the causative genes underlying divergence in sexually selected traits. Here, we investigate the genetic basis of male mating trait diversification in the medaka fishes (genus
              Oryzias
              ) from Sulawesi, Indonesia. Using linkage mapping, transcriptome analysis, and genome editing, we identify
              csf1
              as a causative gene for red pectoral fins that are unique to male
              Oryzias woworae
              . A
              cis
              -regulatory mutation enables androgen-induced expression of
              csf1
              in male fins.
              csf1
              -knockout males have reduced red coloration and require longer for mating, suggesting that coloration can contribute to male reproductive success. Contrary to expectations, non-red males are more attractive to a predatory fish than are red males. Our results demonstrate that integrating genomics with genome editing enables us to identify causative genes underlying sexually selected traits and provides a new avenue for testing theories of sexual selection.},

            Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) and Genomic Prediction/Selection (GP/GS) are the two essential enterprises in genomic research. Due to the great magnitude and complexity of genomic data, analytical methods and their associated software packages are frequently advanced. GAPIT is a widely used Genomic Association and Prediction Integrated Tool. The first version was released to the public in 2012 with the implementation of the general linear model (GLM), mixed linear model (MLM), compressed MLM, and genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (gBLUP). The second version was released in 2016 with several new implementations, including Enriched Compressed MLM and Settlement of mixed linear models Under Progressively Exclusive Relationship (SUPER). All the GWAS methods are based on the single locus test. For the first time, in the current release of GAPIT, version 3 implemented three multiple loci test methods, including Multiple Loci Mixed Model (MLMM), Fixed and random model Circulating Probability Unification (FarmCPU), and Bayesian-information and Linkage-disequilibrium Iteratively Nested Keyway (BLINK). Additionally, two GP/GS methods were implemented based on Compressed MLM, named compressed BLUP, and SUPER, named SUPER BLUP. These new implementations not only boost statistical power for GWAS and prediction accuracy for GP/GS, but also improve computing speed and increase the capacity to analyze big genomic data. Here, we document the current upgrade of GAPIT by describing the selection of the recently developed methods, their implementation, and potential impact. All documents, including source code, user manual, demo data, and tutorials, are freely available at the GAPIT website (

	abstract = {While negative perceptions of insects and other terrestrial arthropods (hereafter referred to collectively as ‘insects’) are widespread around the world, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain unknown. Negative attitudes towards insects manifest as the emotion disgust, which is regarded as a psychological adaptation to produce pathogen-avoidance behavior. Based on theories of evolutionary psychology (parasite avoidance theory of disgust and error management theory), we hypothesized that there are two pathways by which urbanization increases the intensity and breadth of feelings of disgust towards insects: (1) urbanization increases the extent to which people see insects indoors, and insects that are seen more often indoors induce stronger feelings of disgust than is induced by insects seen outdoors; and (2) urbanization reduces people's natural history knowledge about insects, and decreased knowledge results in a broader range of insects eliciting feelings of disgust. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a large-scale online questionnaire survey and questionnaire experiment (n = 13,000) across Japan to quantify the association between the level of urbanization, places of insect sightings (outdoor/ indoor), knowledge about insects, and respondents' feelings of disgust. Our results supported both hypothetical pathway and suggested that psychological mechanisms shaped by past evolutionary pressure to avoid pathogen infection may underlie the current prevalence of insect disgust, and this is being reinforced by urbanization. Because negative perceptions of nature can reduce motivation for its conservation, negative attitudes towards insects exacerbated by ongoing urbanization is a potential global risk for biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Plants inhabited by ants (myrmecophytes) have evolved in a diversity of tropical plant lineages. Macaranga includes approximately 300 paleotropical tree species; in western Malesia there are 26 myrmecophytic species that vary in morphological specializations for ant association. The origin and diversiﬁcation of myrmecophytism in Macaranga was investigated using phylogenetic analyses of morphological and nuclear ITS DNA characters and studies of character evolution. Despite low ITS variation, the combined analysis resulted in a well-supported hypothesis of relationships. Mapping myrmecophytism on all most parsimonious trees resulting from the combined analysis indicated that the trait evolved independently between two and four times and was lost between one and three times (ﬁve changes). This hypothesis was robust when tested against trees constrained to have three or fewer evolutionary transformations, although increased taxon sampling for the ITS analysis is required to conﬁrm this. Mapping morphological traits on the phylogeny indicated that myrmecophytism was not homologous among lineages; each independent origin involved a suite of different specializations for ant-plant association. There was no evidence that myrmecophytic traits underwent sequential change through evolution; self-hollowing domatia evolved independently from ant-excavated domatia, and different food-body production types evolved in different lineages. The multiple origins of myrmecophytism in Macaranga were restricted to one small, exclusively western Malesian lineage of an otherwise large and nonmyrmecophytic genus. Although the evolution of aggregated food-body production and the formation of domatia coincided with the evolution of myrmecophytism in all cases, several morphological, ecological, and biogeographic factors appear to have facilitated and constrained this radiation of ant-plants.},

The whiteﬂy Bemisia tabaci is a cosmopolitan, highly polyphagous agricultural pest that vectors several serious plant pathogenic viruses and is an excellent model to probe the molecular mechanisms involved in overcoming plant defenses. Here, we show that, through an exceptional horizontal gene transfer event, the whiteﬂy has acquired the plant-derived phenolic glucoside malonyltransferase gene BtPMaT1. This gene enables whiteﬂies to neutralize phenolic glucosides. This was conﬁrmed by genetically transforming tomato plants to produce small interfering RNAs that silence BtPMaT1, thus impairing the whiteﬂies’ detoxiﬁcation ability. These ﬁndings reveal an evolutionary scenario whereby herbivores harness the genetic toolkit of their host plants to develop resistance to plant defenses and how this can be exploited for crop protection.},

	abstract = {Selﬁng has evolved in animals, fungi, and plants, and since Darwin’s pioneering study, it is considered one of the most frequent evolutionary trends in ﬂowering plants. Generally, the evolution of selﬁng is characterized by a loss of self-incompatibility, the selﬁng syndrome, and changes in genome-wide polymorphism patterns. Recent interdisciplinary studies involving molecular functional experiments, genome-wide data, experimental evolution, and evolutionary ecology using Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, and other species show that the evolution of selﬁng is not merely a degradation of outcrossing traits but a model for studying the recurrent patterns underlying adaptive molecular evolution. For example, in wild Arabidopsis relatives, selfcompatibility evolved from mutations in the male speciﬁcity gene, S-LOCUS CYSTEINE-RICH PROTEIN/S-LOCUS PROTEIN 11 (SCR/SP11), rather than the female speciﬁcity gene, S-LOCUS RECEPTOR KINASE (SRK), supporting the theoretical prediction of sexual asymmetry. Prevalence of dominant self-compatible mutations is consistent with Haldane’s sieve, which acts against recessive adaptive mutations. Time estimates based on genome-wide polymorphisms and self-incompatibility genes generally support the recent origin of selﬁng.},

	abstract = {Cultural traits such as words, names, decorative styles, and technical standards often assume arbitrary values and are thought to evolve neutrally. But neutral evolution cannot explain why some traits come and go in cycles of popularity while others become entrenched. Here we study frequency-dependent selection (FDS)--where a trait's tendency to be copied depends on its current frequency regardless of the trait value itself. We develop a maximum-likelihood method to infer the precise form of FDS from time series of trait abundance, and we apply the method to data on baby names and pet dog breeds over the last century. We find that the most common names tend to decline by 2\%-6\% per yr on average; whereas rare names--1 in 10,000 births--tend to increase by 1\%-3\% per yr. This specific form of negative FDS explains patterns of diversity and replicates across the United States, France, Norway and the Netherlands, despite cultural, linguistic and demographic variation. We infer a fixed fitness offset between male and female names that implies different rates of innovation. We also find a strong selective advantage for biblical names in every frequency class, which explains their predominance among the most common names. In purebred dog registrations we infer a form of negative FDS that is consistent with a preference for novelty, in which each year's newest breeds outgrow the previous by about 1\%/yr, which also recapitulates boom-bust cycles in dog fanciers. Finally, we define the concept of effective frequency-dependent selection, which enables a meaningful interpretation of inferred FDS even for complex mechanisms of evolution. Our analysis generalizes neutral evolution to incorporate pressures of conformity and anti-conformity as fundamental forces in social evolution, and our inference procedure provides a quantitative account of how these forces operate within and across cultures.},

Currently, data are often published in a repository with an identifier and citation, similar to those for papers. Subsequent publications that use the data are expected to provide a citation in the reference section of the paper. However, the format of the data citation is still evolving, particularly with regards to citing dynamic data, subsets, and collections of data. Considering the motivations of both data producers and consumers, the most pressing need is to create userfriendly solutions that provide credit for data producers and enable accurate citation of data, particularly integrated data. Providing easy-to-use data citations is a critical foundation that is required to address the socio-technical challenges around data integration. Studies that integrate data from dozens or hundreds of datasets must often include data citations in supplementary material due to page limits. However, citations in the supplementary material are not indexed, making it difficult to track citations and thus giving credit to the data producer. In this paper, we discuss our experiences and the challenges we have encountered with current citation guidance. We also review the relative merits of the currently available mechanisms designed to enable compact citation of collections of data, such as data col­ lections, data papers, and dynamic data citations. We consider these options for three data producer scenarios: a domain-specific data collection, a data repository, and a large-scale, multidisciplinary project. We posit that a new mechanism is also needed to enable citation of multiple datasets and credit to data producers.},

	abstract = {Bats inhabit all continents except Antarctica, and they have enormous potential as bioindicators. Therefore, monitoring bats helps us to understand the surrounding environmental changes. However, bats are nocturnal, which makes it difficult to visually monitor their behavior. This paper proposes a bat species identifier method based on the analysis of ultrasound called echolocation calls, which is a promising method to monitor bats’ activity levels effectively. We develop a robust method to identify the bat species with improved accuracy by analyzing their echolocation calls. First, 1400 sound files with four families, 13 genera, and 30 species were recorded in Japan and the Jincheon-gun in South Korea from 1999 to 2019. Bat echolocation calls were detected from the sound files and used to generate 54,525 spectrograms by applying short-time Fourier transform. We developed a deep learning–based bat species identifier using convolutional neural networks with MobileNetV1 used as the model’s architecture. Furthermore, we applied nested cross-validation with the Bayesian optimiza­ tion algorithm to search for the optimal combination of hyperparameters and evaluate the expected performance. We achieved 98.1\% accuracy, which outperformed previous studies that treated more than 30 bat species. We visualized important regions of the spectrograms which correspond to prediction using the Guided Grad-CAM. Moreover, we discussed how to treat the noise class and minimize the model training time. Then, we pro­ posed potential solutions to boost the identifier’s performance, the generalization of the echolocation call recording protocols, and applicable techniques to improve the identification accuracy. Future perspectives are 1) to change the deep learning algorithm from image classification to object detection and 2) to apply the proposed identifier to unknown bat echolocation calls to evaluate the feasibility of estimating bat fauna and spatial activity distribution.},

	abstract = {Trait data represent the basis for ecological and evolutionary research and have relevance for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem management and earth system modelling. The collection and mobilization of trait data has strongly increased over the last decade, but many trait databases still provide only species-level, aggregated trait values (e.g. ranges, means) and lack the direct observations on which those data are based. Thus, the vast majority of trait data measured directly from individuals remains hidden and highly heterogeneous, impeding their discoverability, semantic interoperability, digital accessibility and (re-)use. Here, we integrate quantitative measurements of verbatim trait information from plant individuals (e.g. lengths, widths, counts and angles of stems, leaves, fruits and inflorescence parts) from multiple sources such as field observations and herbarium collections. We develop a workflow to harmonize heterogeneous trait measurements (e.g. trait names and their values and units) as well as additional information related to taxonomy, measurement or fact and occurrence. This data integration and harmonization builds on vocabularies and terminology from existing metadata stan­ dards and ontologies such as the Ecological Trait-data Standard (ETS), the Darwin Core (DwC), the Thesaurus Of Plant characteristics (TOP) and the Plant Trait Ontology (TO). A metadata form filled out by data providers enables the automated integration of trait information from heterogeneous datasets. We illustrate our tools with data from palms (family Arecaceae), a globally distributed (pantropical), diverse plant family that is considered a good model system for understanding the ecology and evolution of tropical rainforests. We mobilize nearly 140,000 individual palm trait measurements in an interoperable format, identify semantic gaps in existing plant trait terminology and provide suggestions for the future development of a thesaurus of plant characteristics. Our work thereby promotes the semantic integration of plant trait data in a machine-readable way and shows how large amounts of small trait data sets and their metadata can be integrated into standardized data products.},

	abstract = {In ecology, a nonconstant functional relationship between per capita growth rate and population size is referred as density dependence and mathematical models are utilized to detect its presence in natural populations. The theta-logistic model (parameterized by rm: intrinsic growth rate; θ: shape parameter; and K: carrying capacity) has been extensively discussed through various generalizations in the literature due to its flexibility and sound ecological interpretations which can be generalized for many natural populations. In this article, we show that nonlinear least squares approach is not an appropriate choice for estimating the model using real data. Using simulation, we show that the unknown parameters are better estimated under a Bayesian framework. We utilize the Gibbs algorithm for simulating samples from the posterior density, which is approximated by grid approx­ imation and Bayesian credible intervals are obtained. Reliability of the estimation process is shown by using simulated data sets. Rules for choosing the prior distributions are discussed. We also apply the proposed strategy to estimate parameters using real data sets from the global population dynamics database. The robustness of the method with respect to prior distribution of the parameters is investigated by taking different choice of priors. We also establish its effectiveness in estimating parameters in a predator-prey system. The discussed method is computationally intensive, but its simple implementation will be useful for fitting complex models to study growth patterns of natural populations.},

This research assesses the potential to use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) detector to identify P. maximus in images of the seabed, recorded using low cost camera technology. A ground truth annotated dataset of images of P. maximus captured in situ was collated. Automatic scallop detectors built into the Video and Image Analytics for Marine Environments (VIAME) toolkit were evaluated on the ground truth dataset. The best performing CNN (NetHarn\_1\_class) was then trained on the annotated training dataset (90\% of the ground truth set) to produce a new detector specifically for P. maximus. The new detector was evaluated on a subset of 208 images (10\% of the ground truth set) with the following results: Precision 0.97, Recall 0.95, F1 Score of 0.96, mAP 0.91, with a confidence threshold of 0.5. These results strongly suggest that application of machine learning and optimisation of the low cost imaging approach is merited with a view to expanding stock assessment and scientific survey methods using this non-destructive and more cost-effective approach.},

	abstract = {Wetlands are an integral part of the socio-ecological setup of the earth, but their fast transformation beg careful consideration. In this regard, the flood plain wetlands of the Atreyee river basin of India and Bangladesh are not exceptional. The main goal of this study is the mapping of the floodplain wetlands, along with arriving at pre­ dictions of their area up to 2039 using the advanced technique of artificial neural network based cellular automata (ANN-CA). Apart from this, prediction of wetland depth using linear regression model is another aim of the present research work. The analysis is executed using 27 Landsat images and Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Results reveal that the present wetland area is 52.92 km2 in pre-monsoon and 518.68 km2 in post-monsoon season, respectively. The composite wetland map from 1987 to 2019 of post-monsoon clearly indicates that 10.48km2 wetlands are identified as hydro-ecologically consistent wetlands. Simulated models reveal that the wetland area from 2009 to 2019 has declined by 66.16km2 and is expected to decrease by 164.62km2 in the next 20 years. Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) depth indicates that water availability also may decline significantly in the next 20 years as per regression model-based simulation. All the simulated models were validated with observed wetland area by kappa coefficient, receiver operating curve. The present study will definitely be useful for decision-makers by aiding them in initiatives that take a significant step toward main­ taining the wetland landscape, as well as the environment.},

	abstract = {In this paper we analyse the classification of zoological illustrations. Historically, zoological illustrations were the modus operandi for the documentation of new species, and now serve as crucial sources for long-term ecological and biodiversity research. By employing computational methods for classification, the data can be made amenable to research. Automated species identification is challenging due to the long-tailed nature of the data, and the millions of possible classes in the species taxonomy. Success commonly depends on large training sets with many examples per class, but images from only a subset of classes are digitally available, and many images are unlabelled, since labelling requires domain expertise. We explore zero-shot learning to address the problem, where features are learned from classes with medium to large samples, which are then transferred to recognise classes with few or no training samples. We specifically explore how distributed, multi-modal back­ ground knowledge from data providers, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), iNaturalist, and the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL), can be used to share knowledge between classes for zero-shot learning. We train a prototypical network for zero-shot classification, and introduce fused prototypes (FP) and hierarchical prototype loss (HPL) to optimise the model. Finally, we analyse the performance of the model for use in real-world applications. The experimental results are encouraging, indicating potential for use of such models in an expert support system, but also express the difficulty of our task, showing a necessity for research into computer vision methods that are able to learn from small samples.},

First, relationships between the (Bayesian) variance of marker effects in some regression models and additive genetic variance are examined under standard assumptions. Second, the connection between marker genotypes and resemblance between relatives is explored, and linkages between a marker-based model and the inﬁnitesimal model are reviewed. Third, issues associated with the use of Bayesian models for marker-assisted selection, with a focus on the role of the priors, are examined from a theoretical angle. The sensitivity of a Bayesian speciﬁcation that has been proposed (called ‘‘Bayes A’’) with respect to priors is illustrated with a simulation. Methods that can solve potential shortcomings of some of these Bayesian regression procedures are discussed brieﬂy.},

	abstract = {The genomic prediction of phenotypes and breeding values in animals and plants has developed rapidly into its own research ﬁeld. Results of genomic prediction studies are often difﬁcult to compare because data simulation varies, real or simulated data are not fully described, and not all relevant results are reported. In addition, some new methods have been compared only in limited genetic architectures, leading to potentially misleading conclusions. In this article we review simulation procedures, discuss validation and reporting of results, and apply benchmark procedures for a variety of genomic prediction methods in simulated and real example data. Plant and animal breeding programs are being transformed by the use of genomic data, which are becoming widely available and cost-effective to predict genetic merit. A large number of genomic prediction studies have been published using both simulated and real data. The relative novelty of this area of research has made the development of scientiﬁc conventions difﬁcult with regard to description of the real data, simulation of genomes, validation and reporting of results, and forward in time methods. In this review article we discuss the generation of simulated genotype and phenotype data, using approaches such as the coalescent and forward in time simulation. We outline ways to validate simulated data and genomic prediction results, including cross-validation. The accuracy and bias of genomic prediction are highlighted as performance indicators that should be reported. We suggest that a measure of relatedness between the reference and validation individuals be reported, as its impact on the accuracy of genomic prediction is substantial. A large number of methods were compared in example simulated and real (pine and wheat) data sets, all of which are publicly available. In our limited simulations, most methods performed similarly in traits with a large number of quantitative trait loci (QTL), whereas in traits with fewer QTL variable selection did have some advantages. In the real data sets examined here all methods had very similar accuracies. We conclude that no single method can serve as a benchmark for genomic prediction. We recommend comparing accuracy and bias of new methods to results from genomic best linear prediction and a variable selection approach (e.g., BayesB), because, together, these methods are appropriate for a range of genetic architectures. An accompanying article in this issue provides a comprehensive review of genomic prediction methods and discusses a selection of topics related to application of genomic prediction in plants and animals.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in molecular genetic techniques will make dense marker maps available and genotyping many individuals for these markers feasible. Here we attempted to estimate the effects of ف50,000 marker haplotypes simultaneously from a limited number of phenotypic records. A genome of 1000 cM was simulated with a marker spacing of 1 cM. The markers surrounding every 1-cM region were combined into marker haplotypes. Due to ﬁnite population size (Ne ϭ 100), the marker haplotypes were in linkage disequilibrium with the QTL located between the markers. Using least squares, all haplotype effects could not be estimated simultaneously. When only the biggest effects were included, they were overestimated and the accuracy of predicting genetic values of the offspring of the recorded animals was only 0.32. Best linear unbiased prediction of haplotype effects assumed equal variances associated to each 1-cM chromosomal segment, which yielded an accuracy of 0.73, although this assumption was far from true. Bayesian methods that assumed a prior distribution of the variance associated with each chromosome segment increased this accuracy to 0.85, even when the prior was not correct. It was concluded that selection on genetic values predicted from markers could substantially increase the rate of genetic gain in animals and plants, especially if combined with reproductive techniques to shorten the generation interval.},

Building on this foundation, many methods have since been developed to increase computational speed or improve statistical power in GWAS. These methods have allowed the detection of genomic variants associated with either traditional agronomic phenotypes or biochemical and molecular phenotypes. In turn, these associations enable applications in gene cloning and in accelerated crop breeding through marker assisted selection or genetic engineering. Current topics of investigation include rare-variant analysis, synthetic associations, optimizing the choice of GWAS model, and utilizing GWAS results to advance knowledge of biological processes.

	abstract = {Plant species exhibiting polymorphisms with respect to ﬂower color are widespread. Our understanding of the selection pressures that may maintain these color polymorphisms has primarily been conﬁned to one set of organisms—pollinators. Yet, selection on ﬂower color may also be driven by other agents, such as herbivores, especially in cases where pollinators and herbivores are using the same or correlated traits to select plants. A wealth of studies have documented pollinator preference for anthocyanin-recessive color morphs (AϪ; yellow and white ﬂowers) of wild radish, Raphanus sativus, over anthocyanin-dominant morphs (Aϩ; pink and bronze ﬂowers); yet, differences in pollination alone do not explain the maintenance of the ﬂower color polymorphism. Here, we ask whether variation in ﬂower color in R. sativus inﬂuences the preference and performance of herbivores for AϪ ﬂower color morphs vs. Aϩ ﬂower color morphs in four types of herbivores (generalist and specialist Lepidoptera, slugs, aphids, and thrips). We found that all herbivores except for aphids and thrips preferred ﬂowering AϪ color morphs compared to Aϩ morphs of R. sativus. Furthermore, all herbivores except larvae of specialist and generalist Lepidoptera performed better on AϪ color morphs. Differences in plant secondary chemistry may play a role in differential herbivore preference and performance on the anthocyanin ﬂower color morphs. Chemical analyses of leaf secondary compounds (indole glucosinolates) revealed that Aϩ color morphs produced higher concentrations of indole glucosinolates than AϪ morphs in the presence of herbivore damage. Therefore, herbivores may exhibit lower preference for Aϩ color morphs, and these morphs may support lower herbivore performance because they are heavily defended once damaged. This is the ﬁrst study, to our knowledge, to document differential preference and performance of herbivores for different ﬂower color morphs. Previous studies have shown that increased herbivore damage can have profound negative direct and indirect effects on the reproduction of R. sativus. The data presented here suggest that differential preference and performance of herbivores for R. sativus color morphs may counter selection on ﬂower color exerted by pollinators.},

	abstract = {To determine whether population differentiation in ﬂowering time is consistent with differences in current selection, we quantiﬁed phenotypic selection acting through female reproductive success on ﬂowering phenology and ﬂoral display in two Scandinavian populations of the outcrossing, perennial herb Arabidopsis lyrata in two years. One population was located in an alpine environment strongly affected by grazing, whereas the other was close to sea level and only moderately affected by herbivory. Multiple regression models indicated directional selection for early end of ﬂowering in one year in the lowland population, and directional selection for early start of ﬂowering in one year in the alpine population. As expected, there was selection for more inﬂorescences in the lowland population. However, in the alpine population, plants with many inﬂorescences were selectively grazed and the number of inﬂorescences produced was negatively related to female ﬁtness in one year and not signiﬁcantly related to female ﬁtness in the second year. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that genetic differentiation in ﬂowering phenology between the study populations is adaptive, and indicate that interactions with selective grazers may strongly inﬂuence selection on ﬂoral display in A. lyrata.},

	abstract = {Mixed cropping has been suggested as a resource-efﬁcient approach to meet high produce demands while maintaining biodiversity and minimizing environmental impact. Current breeding programs do not select for enhanced general mixing ability (GMA) and neglect biological interactions within species mixtures. Clear concepts and efﬁcient experimental designs, adapted to breeding for mixed cropping and encoded into appropriate statistical models, are lacking. Thus, a model framework for GMA and SMA (speciﬁc mixing ability) was established. Results of a simulation study showed that an incomplete factorial design combines advantages of two commonly used full factorials, and enables to estimate GMA, SMA, and their variances in a resource-efﬁcient way. This model was extended to the Producer (Pr) and Associate (As) concept to exploit additional information based on fraction yields. It was shown that the Pr/As concept allows to characterize genotypes for their contribution to total mixture yield, and, when relating to plant traits, allows to describe biological interaction functions (BIF) in a mixed crop. Incomplete factorial designs show the potential to drastically improve genetic gain by testing an increased number of genotypes using the same amount of resources. The Pr/As concept can further be employed to maximize GMA in an informed and efﬁcient way. The BIF of a trait can be used to optimize species ratios at harvest as well as to extend our understanding of competitive and facilitative interactions in a mixed plant community. This study provides an integrative methodological framework to promote breeding for mixed cropping.},

	abstract = {Intercrop breeding programs using genomic selection can produce faster genetic gain than intercrop breeding programs using phenotypic selection. Intercropping is an agricultural practice in which two or more component crops are grown together. It can lead to enhanced soil structure and fertility, improved weed suppression, and better control of pests and diseases. Especially in subsistence agriculture, intercropping has great potential to optimize farming and increase proﬁtability. However, breeding for intercrop varieties is complex as it requires simultaneous improvement of two or more component crops that combine well in the ﬁeld. We hypothesize that genomic selection can signiﬁcantly simplify and accelerate the process of breeding crops for intercropping. Therefore, we used stochastic simulation to compare four different intercrop breeding programs implementing genomic selection and an intercrop breeding program entirely based on phenotypic selection. We assumed three different levels of genetic correlation between monocrop grain yield and intercrop grain yield to investigate how the different breeding strategies are impacted by this factor. We found that all four simulated breeding programs using genomic selection produced signiﬁcantly more intercrop genetic gain than the phenotypic selection program regardless of the genetic correlation with monocrop yield. We suggest a genomic selection strategy which combines monocrop and intercrop trait information to predict general intercropping ability to increase selection accuracy in the early stages of a breeding program and to minimize the generation interval.},

In an interaction between a seed-predatory insect, the camellia weevil (Curculio camelliae), and its host plant, the Japanese camellia (Camellia japonica), I tested whether the evolutionary differentiation of the plant’s defensive trait, pericarp thickness, was related to the interpopulation variation in the foraging behaviour of female weevils. I found that the preference of weevils for the plant fruit based on pericarp thickness varied across 13 populations in Japan. Importantly, variation in weevil behaviour explained interpopulation variation in pericarp thickness and the direction/ strength of natural selection on the trait. Overall, I show that adaptive foraging of predators can result in the evolutionary divergence of predator–prey interactions.},

Six plots were established in 1997 in the Sierra Nevada, Spain; three were fenced to exclude native ungulates, and the remaining were open to ungulates. I determined pollinator and ungulate preferences for plant traits and their effect on plant fecundity. Then I compared the selection regimes between plants excluded from herbivores and plants open to them. When ungulates were absent, I found signiﬁcant selection on ﬂower number, reproductive stalk height, basal diameter of the stalks, petal length, and inner diameter of the ﬂowers. When ungulates were present, selection on ﬂoral traits completely disappeared, and selection strength on ﬂower number and morphological traits decreased. This effect was due to the ungulate preference for larger plants and the phenotypic correlations between plant size and ﬂoral traits. Results suggest that pollinator-mediated selection can be disrupted by conﬂicting effects of plant enemies acting during or subsequent to pollination. An accurate picture of the pollinator role as selective pressure requires the consideration of the entire life cycle of the plant as well as the ecological scenario in which the interactions occur.},

The abundance and diversity of the pollinator assemblage of plants excluded from and exposed to mammalian herbivores, and the combined eﬀect of pollinators and herbivores on plant reproduction were determined over a period of 2 years. Pollinator abundance was higher and diversity was lower on plants excluded from herbivores. Furthermore, the experimental exclusions demonstrated that both pollinators and herbivores aﬀected plant ﬁtness, but their eﬀects were not independent. Herbivores only had a detrimental eﬀect on plant ﬁtness when pollinators were present. Similarly, pollinators enhanced ﬁtness only when herbivores were excluded. This outcome demonstrates that the importance of pollinators for plant ﬁtness depends on the occurrence of herbivores, and suggests that herbivores may hamper pollinator-mediated adaptation in plants.},

Selection by mutualists and antagonists may not be independent from each other, however, as the selection on a trait through one interaction can depend on the presence or intensity of another interaction. Bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) and cabbage butterﬂies (Pieris brassicae) are both pollinators of Brassica rapa, but cabbage butterﬂies also use B. rapa as a host plant for their caterpillars. In a cage experiment we exposed B. rapa plants to (a) bumble bees, (b) cabbage butterﬂies, and (c) bumble bees and cabbage butterﬂies together and analysed the resulting patterns of selection. We found an association between ﬂower visitation and corolla size as well as the scent compound phenylacetaldehyde for both bumble bees and cabbage butterﬂies. Additionally, oviposition by butterﬂies was associated with the same two ﬂoral signals. Whereas corolla size was under positive selection in all three pollinator treatments, selection on phenylacetaldehyde was found only in the ‘‘pure’’ bumble bee treatment. Additionally, in plants exposed to both insect species negative correlational selection on corolla size and phenylacetaldehyde was found, as well as nonadditive selection on phenylacetaldehyde. These results demonstrate a strong overlap in the preferences for ﬂoral traits in pollinators and herbivores causing a conﬂict between the attraction of mutualists and the avoidance of antagonists. Further, our study shows that interactive effects on ﬁtness by mutualists and antagonists can contribute to complex selection patterns.},

Supplemental hand-pollination increased female ﬁtness by 31\% and one-quarter of all plants were damaged by herbivores. Both interactions contributed to selection. Pollinators mediated selection for later ﬂowering and herbivores for earlier ﬂowering, while both selected for longer spurs. The strength of selection was similar for both agents, and their effects were additive. As a consequence, there was no net selection on phenology, whereas selection on spur length was strong. The experimental results demonstrate that both pollinators and herbivores can markedly inﬂuence the strength of selection on ﬂowering phenology and ﬂoral morphology, and cause both conﬂicting and reinforcing selection. They also indicate that the direction of selection on phenology will vary with the relative intensity of the mutualistic and antagonistic interaction, potentially resulting in both temporal and among-population variation in optimal ﬂowering time.},

This pattern of selection likely helped generate the broad-sense genetic correlation (r ¼ 0.42) between ﬂoral-sex ratio and resistance to herbivory.

While the mechanisms of sensing shading by other plants are well-known and appear conserved across plants, less is known about the developmental mechanisms that result in the diverse array of morphological and phenological responses to shading. This is particularly true for traits that appear later in plant development. Here we use a nested association mapping (NAM) population of Arabidopsis thaliana to decipher the genetic architecture of the shade avoidance response in late-vegetative and reproductive plants. We focused on four traits: bolting time, rosette size, inﬂorescence growth rate, and inﬂorescence size, found plasticity in each trait in response to shade, and detected 17 total QTL; at least one of which is a novel locus not previously identiﬁed for shade responses in Arabidopsis. Using path analysis, we dissected each colocalizing QTL into direct effects on each trait and indirect effects transmitted through direct effects on earlier developmental traits. Doing this separately for each of the seven NAM populations in each environment, we discovered considerable heterogeneity among the QTL effects across populations, suggesting allelic series at multiple QTL or interactions between QTL and the genetic background or the environment. Our results provide insight into the development and variation in shade avoidance responses in Arabidopsis, and emphasize the value of directly modeling the relationships among traits when studying the genetics of complex developmental syndromes.},

This model predicts an initial deceleration and then an accelerating increase in the intensity of selection with increasing strength of antagonistic interactions and with decreasing strength of mutualistic interactions. Empirical data from several studies provide support for this model.

In large part, this was fueled by advances in genomic technology, enabling us to examine genome-wide genetic variants across diverse genetic materials. The development of the mixed model framework for GWAS dramatically reduced the number of false positives compared with naïve methods. Building on this foundation, many methods have since been developed to increase computational speed or improve statistical power in GWAS. These methods have allowed the detection of genomic variants associated with either traditional agronomic phenotypes or biochemical and molecular phenotypes. In turn, these associations enable applications in gene cloning and in accelerated crop breeding through marker assisted selection or genetic engineering. Current topics of investigation include rare-variant analysis, synthetic associations, optimizing the choice of GWAS model, and utilizing GWAS results to advance knowledge of biological processes. Ongoing research in these areas will facilitate further advances in GWAS methods and their applications.},

	abstract = {Offspring number and size are key traits determining an individual’s ﬁtness and a crop’s yield. Yet, extensive natural variation within species is observed for these traits. Such variation is typically explained by trade-offs between fecundity and quality, for which an optimal solution is environmentally dependent. Understanding the genetic basis of seed size and number, as well as any possible genetic constraints preventing the maximization of both, is crucial from both an evolutionary and applied perspective. We investigated the genetic basis of natural variation in seed size and number using a set of Arabidopsis thaliana multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) lines. We also tested whether life history affects seed size, number, and their trade-off. We found that both seed size and seed number are affected by a large number of mostly nonoverlapping QTL, suggesting that seed size and seed number can evolve independently. The allele that increases seed size at most identiﬁed QTL is from the same natural accession, indicating past occurrence of directional selection for seed size. Although a signiﬁcant trade-off between seed size and number is observed, its expression depends on life-history characteristics, and generally explains little variance. We conclude that the trade-off between seed size and number might have a minor role in explaining the maintenance of variation in seed size and number, and that seed size could be a valid target for selection.},

	abstract = {Background: Rice, Oryza sativa L., is the staple food for half the world’s population. By 2030, the production of rice must increase by at least 25\% in order to keep up with global population growth and demand. Accelerated genetic gains in rice improvement are needed to mitigate the effects of climate change and loss of arable land, as well as to ensure a stable global food supply. Findings: We resequenced a core collection of 3,000 rice accessions from 89 countries. All 3,000 genomes had an average sequencing depth of 14×, with average genome coverages and mapping rates of 94.0\% and 92.5\%, respectively. From our sequencing efforts, approximately 18.9 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in rice were discovered when aligned to the reference genome of the temperate japonica variety, Nipponbare. Phylogenetic analyses based on SNP data confirmed differentiation of the O. sativa gene pool into 5 varietal groups – indica, aus/boro, basmati/sadri, tropical japonica and temperate japonica. Conclusions: Here, we report an international resequencing effort of 3,000 rice genomes. This data serves as a foundation for large-scale discovery of novel alleles for important rice phenotypes using various bioinformatics and/or genetic approaches. It also serves to understand the genomic diversity within O. sativa at a higher level of detail. With the release of the sequencing data, the project calls for the global rice community to take advantage of this data as a foundation for establishing a global, public rice genetic/genomic database and information platform for advancing rice breeding technology for future rice improvement.},

	abstract = {We focused on male harassment on different female color morphs of the damselfly Ischnura elegans and on variation in morph-specific mating avoidance tactics by females. In I. elegans, one of the female morphs is colored like the conspecific male (andromorphs) while the other morphs are not (gynomorphs). Our first goal was to quantify morph-specific male mating attempts, hence male harassment, in populations with manipulated population parameters (densities, sex ratios, and proportion of andromorphs). Second, we examined the female’s perspective by looking for potential differences in morph-specific mating avoidance tactics and success of those tactics in a natural population. Differences in population conditions did influence the number of male mating attempts per morph. The less frequent female morph was always subject to fewer mating attempts, which contradicts earlier hypotheses on mimicry, but supports those that assume that males learn to recognize female morphs. Gynomorphs occupy less open habitat and often fly away when a male approaches, while andromorphs use more open habitat, do not fly large distances and directly face approaching males. Female morphs did not differ in the proportion of successful mating-avoidance attempts. Our results suggest that the maintenance of the color polymorphism is most probably the result of interactive selective forces depending on variation in all population conditions, instead of solely density- or frequency-dependent selection within populations.},

	abstract = {Interaction among individuals is universal, both in animals and in plants, and substantially affects evolution of natural populations and responses to artiﬁcial selection in agriculture. Although quantitative genetics has successfully been applied to many traits, it does not provide a general theory accounting for interaction among individuals and selection acting on multiple levels. Consequently, current quantitative genetic theory fails to explain why some traits do not respond to selection among individuals, but respond greatly to selection among groups. Understanding the full impacts of heritable interactions on the outcomes of selection requires a quantitative genetic framework including all levels of selection and relatedness. Here we present such a framework and provide expressions for the response to selection. Results show that interaction among individuals may create substantial heritable variation, which is hidden to classical analyses. Selection acting on higher levels of organization captures this hidden variation and therefore always yields positive response, whereas individual selection may yield response in the opposite direction. Our work provides testable predictions of response to multilevel selection and reduces to classical theory in the absence of interaction. Statistical methodology provided elsewhere enables empirical application of our work to both natural and domestic populations.},

As a consequence, predicted responses to multilevel selection applied to this population are threefold greater than classical predictions.

              An individual tree model with additive direct and competition effects is introduced to account for competitive effects in forest genetics evaluation. The mixed linear model includes fixed effects as well as direct and competition breeding values plus permanent environmental effects. Competition effects, either additive or environmental, are identified in the phenotype of a competitor tree by means of ‘intensity of competition’ elements (IC), which are non-zero elements of the incidence matrix of the additive competition effects. The ICs are inverse function of the distance and the number of competing individuals, either row-column wise or diagonally. The ICs allow standardization of the variance of competition effects in the phenotypic variance of any individual tree, so that the model accounts for unequal number of neighbors. Expressions are obtained for the bias in estimating additive variance using the covariance between half-sibs, when ignoring competition effects for row-plot designs and for single-tree plot designs. A data set of loblolly pines on growth at breast height is used to estimate the additive variances of direct and competition effects, the covariance between both effects, and the variance of permanent environmental effects using a Bayesian method via Gibbs sampling and Restricted Maximum Likelihood procedures (REML) via the Expectation- Maximization (EM) algorithm. No problem of convergence was detected with the model and ICs used when compared to what has been reported in the animal breeding literature for such models.

To establish genotype-phenotype relationships and advance MAS in apple, we extracted over 24,000 phenotype scores from the USDA-Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN) database and linked them with over 8000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 689 apple accessions from the USDA apple germplasm collection clonally preserved in Geneva, NY. We find significant genetic differentiation between Old World and New World cultivars and demonstrate that the genetic structure of the domesticated apple also reflects the time required for ripening. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 36 phenotypes confirms the association between fruit color and the MYB1 locus, and we also report a novel association between the transcription factor, NAC18.1, and harvest date and fruit firmness. We demonstrate that harvest time and fruit size can be predicted with relatively high accuracies (r {\textgreater} 0.46) using genomic prediction. Rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in apples means millions of SNPs may be required for well-powered GWAS. However, rapid LD decay also promises to enable extremely high resolution mapping of causal variants, which holds great potential for advancing MAS.},

However, little is known about the composition and function of the SAGA complex in plants. In this study, we found that the SAGA complex in Arabidopsis thaliana contains not only conserved subunits but also four plant-speciﬁc subunits: three functionally redundant paralogs, SCS1, SCS2A, and SCS2B (SCS1/2A/2B), and a TAF-like subunit, TAFL. Mutations in SCS1/2A/2B lead to defective phenotypes similar to those caused by mutations in the genes encoding conserved SAGA subunits HAG1 and ADA2B, including delayed juvenile-to-adult phase transition, late ﬂowering, and increased trichome density. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SCS1/2A/2B are required for the function of the SAGA complex in histone acetylation, thereby promoting the transcription of development-related genes. These results together suggest that SCS1/2A/2B are core subunits of the SAGA complex in Arabidopsis. Compared with SAGA complexes in other eukaryotes, the SAGA complexes in plants have evolved unique features that are necessary for normal growth and development.},

For many rare insect classes, collecting a large number of training samples is infeasible or even impossible. In contrast, humans are able to recognize a new object class with little supervision. This motivates us to address the problems of small-sample recognition and fine-grained recognition for insects by combining recognition and localization; this can provide an effective remedy for data scarcity and the two techniques can bootstrap from each other. In this paper, we propose a saliency-detection model to localize the key regions that have the largest discriminative features for fine-grained insect classification. The learner learns to predict foreground and background masks for such localization, having been trained on a training set annotated with bounding boxes. Additionally, to further generate discriminative features, a center neighbor loss function is used to construct a robust feature-space distribution. The proposed model is trained end-to-end on our small-sample learning dataset, which comprises 220 insect categories from a real-world complex environment. Compared with the method using prototypical networks, the proposed method achieves a superior performance, with a mean recognition rate (top-5 accuracy) of 57.65\%, and can effectively recognize insects under small-sample and complex-scene conditions.},

However, biological datasets often have constraints that are challenging for the use of deep learning. Classes are often imbalanced, similar, or too few for robust learning. In this paper we present a robust method relying on hierarchical classiﬁcation to perform very small object detection. We illustrate our results on a custom dataset featuring 22 classes of arthropods used to study biodiversity. This dataset shows several constraints that are frequent when using deep learning on biological data with a high class imbalance, some classes learned on only a few training examples and a high similarity between classes. We propose to ﬁrst perform detection at a super-class level, before performing a detailed classiﬁcation at a class level. We compare the obtained results with our proposed method to a global detector, trained without hierarchical classiﬁcation. Our method succeeds in obtaining a mAP of 75 \%, while the global detector only achieves a mAP of 48 \%. Moreover, our method shows high precision even on classes with the less train examples. Confusions between classes with our method are fewer and are of a lesser impact. We are able achieve a more robust object classiﬁcation with the use of our proposed method. This method can also enable better control on the model’s output which can be particularly valuable when handling ecological, biological or medical data for example.},

The following paper explores the popularity and the performance of all the GSA methodologies and software published during the 20 years since its inception. "Popularity" is estimated according to each paper’s citation counts, while "performance" is based on a comprehensive evaluation of the validation strategies used by papers in the field, as well as the consolidated results from the existing benchmark studies.
Results:  Regarding popularity, data is collected into an online open database ("GSARefDB") which allows browsing bibliographic and method-descriptive information from 503 GSA paper references; regarding performance, we introduce a repository of jupyter workflows and shiny apps for automated benchmarking of GSA methods (“GSA-BenchmarKING”). After comparing popularity versus performance, results show discrepancies between the most popular and the best performing GSA methods.
Conclusions:  The above-mentioned results call our attention towards the nature of the tool selection procedures followed by researchers and raise doubts regarding the quality of the functional interpretation of biological datasets in current biomedical studies. Suggestions for the future of the functional interpretation field are made, including strategies for education and discussion of GSA tools, better validation and benchmarking practices, reproducibility, and functional re-analysis of previously reported data.},

	abstract = {Recent synthesis studies have shown inconsistent responses of crop pests to landscape composition, imposing a fundamental limit to our capacity to design sustainable crop protection strategies to reduce yield losses caused by insect pests. Using a global dataset composed of 5242 observations encompassing 48 agricultural pest species and 26 crop species, we tested the role of pest traits (exotic status, host breadth and habitat breadth) and environmental context (crop type, range in landscape gradient and climate) in modifying the pest response to increasing semi-natural habitats in the surrounding landscape. For natives, increasing semi-natural habitats decreased the abundance of pests that exploit only crop habitats or that are highly polyphagous. On the contrary, populations of exotic pests increased with an increasing cover of semi-natural habitats. These effects might be related to changes in host plants and other resources across the landscapes and/or to modified top-down control by natural enemies. The range of the landscape gradient explored and climate did not affect pests, while crop type modified the response of pests to landscape composition. Although species traits and environmental context helped in explaining some of the variability in pest response to landscape composition, the observed large interspecific differences suggest that a portfolio of strategies must be considered and implemented for the effective control of rapidly changing communities of crop pests in agroecosystems.},

	abstract = {Detection of small objects in large swaths of imagery is one of the primary problems in satellite imagery analytics. While object detection in ground-based imagery has benefited from research into new deep learning approaches, transitioning such technology to overhead imagery is nontrivial. Among the challenges is the sheer number of pixels and geographic extent per image: a single DigitalGlobe satellite image encompasses {\textgreater}64 km2 and over 250 million pixels. Another challenge is that objects of interest are minuscule (often only {\textasciitilde}10 pixels in extent), which complicates traditional computer vision techniques. To address these issues, we propose a pipeline (You Only Look Twice, or YOLT) that evaluates satellite images of arbitrary size at a rate of {\textgreater}0.5 km2/s. The proposed approach can rapidly detect objects of vastly different scales with relatively little training data over multiple sensors. We evaluate large test images at native resolution, and yield scores of F1 {\textgreater} 0.8 for vehicle localization. We further explore resolution and object size requirements by systematically testing the pipeline at decreasing resolution, and conclude that objects only {\textasciitilde}5 pixels in size can still be localized with high confidence.

Nevertheless, it is often classified as an orphan/underutilized crop because of the paucity of scientific attention. Among several small millets, finger millet is considered as an excellent source of essential nutrient elements, such as iron and zinc; hence, it has potential as an alternate coarse cereal. However, high-quality genome sequence data of finger millet are currently not available. One of the major problems encountered in the genome assembly of this species was its polyploidy, which hampers genome assembly compared with a diploid genome. To overcome this problem, we sequenced its genome using diverse technologies with sufficient coverage and assembled it via a novel multiple hybrid assembly workflow that combines nextgeneration with single-molecule sequencing, followed by whole-genome optical mapping using the Bionano IrysVR system. The total number of scaffolds was 1,897 with an N50 length {\textgreater}2.6 Mb and detection of 96\% of the universal single-copy orthologs. The majority of the homeologs were assembled separately. This indicates that the proposed workflow is applicable to the assembly of other allotetraploid genomes.},

	abstract = {Frequency‐dependent (FD) selection is a central process maintaining genetic variation and mediating evolution of population fitness. FD selection has attracted interest from researchers in a wide range of biological subdisciplines, including evolutionary genetics, behavioural ecology and, more recently, community ecology. However, the implications of frequency dependence for applied biological problems, particularly maladaptation, biological conservation and evolutionary rescue remain underexplored. The neglect of FD selection in conservation is particularly unfortunate. Classical theory, dating back to the 1940s, demonstrated that frequency dependence can either increase or decrease population fitness. These evolutionary consequences of FD selection are relevant to modern concerns about population persistence and the capacity of evolution to alleviate extinction risks. But exactly when should we expect FD selection to increase versus decrease absolute fitness and population growth? And how much of an impact is FD selection expected to have on population persistence versus extinction in changing environments? The answers to these questions have implications for evolutionary rescue under climate change and may inform strategies for managing threatened populations. Here, we revisit the core theory of FD selection, reviewing classical single‐locus models of population genetic change and outlining short‐ and long‐run consequences of FD selection for the evolution of population fitness. We then develop a quantitative genetic model of evolutionary rescue in a deteriorating environment, with population persistence hinging upon the evolution of a quantitative trait subject to both frequency‐dependent and frequencyindependent natural selection. We discuss the empirical literature pertinent to this theory, which supports key assumptions of our model. We show that FD selection can promote population persistence when it aligns with the direction of frequencyindependent selection imposed by abiotic environmental conditions. However, under most scenarios of environmental change, FD selection limits a population’s evolutionary responsiveness to changing conditions and narrows the rate of environmental change that is evolutionarily tolerable.},

Bolton et al.

Bolton et al. (Molecular Ecology, 2015, 24, 2907) further state that there is no clear evidence from studies of ‘true polymorphic species’ that polymorphism promotes population persistence. In response, I (i) challenge their classiﬁcations of polymorphisms and revisit the traditional deﬁnitions recognizing the dynamic nature of polymorphisms, (ii) review empirical studies that have examined whether and how polymorphism is associated with extinction risk, (iii) discuss the roles of trait correlations between colour pattern and other phenotypic dimensions for population ﬁtness and (iv) highlight that the causes and mechanisms that inﬂuence the composition and maintenance of polymorphisms are different from the consequences of the polymorphic condition and how it may impact on aspects of ecological success and long-term persistence of populations and species.},

	abstract = {Spatial autocorrelation analysis is a well-established technique for detecting spatial structures and patterns in ecology. However, compared to inter-population genetic structure, much less studies examined spatial genetic structure (SGS) within a population by means of spatial autocorrelation analysis. More SGS analysis that compares the robustness of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traditional population genetic markers in detecting SGS, and direct comparison between the estimated dispersal range based on SGS and the larval dispersal range of corals directly surveyed in the ﬁeld would be important. In this study, we examined the SGS of a reef-building coral species, Heliopora coerulea, in two different reefs (Shiraho and Akaishi) using genome-wide SNPs derived from Multiplexed inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) genotyping by sequencing (MIG-seq) analysis and nine microsatellite loci for comparison. Microsatellite data failed to reveal signiﬁcant spatial patterns when using the same number of samples as MIG-seq, whereas MIG-seq analysis revealed signiﬁcant spatial autocorrelation patterns up to 750 m in both Shiraho and Akaishi reefs based on the maximum signiﬁcant distance method. However, detailed spatial genetic analysis using ﬁne-scale distance classes (25–200 m) found an x-intercept of 255–392 m in Shiraho and that of 258–330 m in Akaishi reef. The latter results agreed well with a previously reported direct ﬁeld observation of larval dispersal, indicating that the larvae of H. coerulea settled within a 350 m range in Shiraho reef within one generation. Overall, our results empirically demonstrate that the x-intercept of the spatial correlogram agrees well with the larval dispersal distance that is most frequently found in ﬁeld observations, and they would be useful for deciding effective conservation management units for maintenance and/or recovery within an ecological time scale.},

	abstract = {Multiparental genetic mapping populations such as nested-association mapping (NAM) have great potential for investigating quantitative traits and associated genomic regions leading to rapid discovery of candidate genes and markers. To demonstrate the utility and power of this approach, two NAM populations, NAM\_Tifrunner and NAM\_Florida-07, were used for dissecting genetic control of 100-pod weight (PW) and 100-seed weight (SW) in peanut. Two high-density SNP-based genetic maps were constructed with 3341 loci and 2668 loci for NAM\_Tifrunner and NAM\_Florida-07, respectively. The quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis identiﬁed 12 and 8 major effect QTLs for PW and SW, respectively, in NAM\_Tifrunner, and 13 and 11 major effect QTLs for PW and SW, respectively, in NAM\_Florida-07. Most of the QTLs associated with PW and SW were mapped on the chromosomes A05, A06, B05 and B06. A genomewide association study (GWAS) analysis identiﬁed 19 and 28 highly signiﬁcant SNP–trait associations (STAs) in NAM\_Tifrunner and 11 and 17 STAs in NAM\_Florida-07 for PW and SW, respectively. These signiﬁcant STAs were co-localized, suggesting that PW and SW are co-regulated by several candidate genes identiﬁed on chromosomes A05, A06, B05, and B06. This study demonstrates the utility of NAM population for genetic dissection of complex traits and performing highresolution trait mapping in peanut.},

In the ﬁrst part of this work, I summarize the formulas for several mean-ﬁeld approximations and I derive new analytical expressions for the Bethe approximation, which allow one to solve the inverse Ising problem without running the susceptibility propagation algorithm (thus avoiding the lack of convergence). In the second part, I compare the accuracy of diﬀerent mean-ﬁeld approximations on several models (diluted ferromagnets and spin glasses) deﬁned on random graphs and regular lattices, showing which one is in general more eﬀective. A simple improvement over these approximations is proposed. Also a fundamental limitation is found in using methods based on TAP and Bethe approximations in the presence of an external ﬁeld.},

Forty-seven Xoo virulence-related genes and 318 rice quantitative resistance genes (QR-genes) mainly located in 41 genomic regions, and genome-wide interactions between the detected virulence-related genes and QR genes were identiﬁed, including well-known resistance genes/virulence genes plus many previously uncharacterized ones. The relationship between rice and Xoo was characterized by strong differentiation among Xoo races corresponding to the subspeciﬁc differentiation of rice, by strong shifts toward increased resistance/virulence of rice/Xoo populations and by rich genetic diversity at the detected rice QR-genes and Xoo virulence genes, and by genome-wide interactions between many rice QR-genes and Xoo virulence genes in a multiple-to-multiple manner, presumably resulting either from direct protein–protein interactions or from genetic epistasis. The observed complex genetic interaction system between rice and Xoo likely exists in other crop–pathogen systems that would maintain high levels of diversity at their QR-loci/virulence-loci, resulting in dynamic coevolutionary consequences during their reciprocal adaptation.},

              Bacillus thuringiensis
              (Bt) has suppressed some major pests, reduced insecticide sprays, enhanced pest control by natural enemies, and increased grower profits. However, rapid evolution of resistance in pests is reducing these benefits. Better understanding of the genetic basis of resistance to Bt crops is urgently needed to monitor, delay, and counter pest resistance. We discovered that a point mutation in a previously unknown tetraspanin gene in the cotton bollworm (
              Helicoverpa armigera
              ), a devastating global pest, confers dominant resistance to Cry1Ac, the sole Bt protein produced by transgenic cotton planted in China. We found the mutation using a genome-wide association study, followed by fine-scale genetic mapping and DNA sequence comparisons between resistant and susceptible strains. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of the tetraspanin gene restored susceptibility to a resistant strain, whereas inserting the mutation conferred 125-fold resistance in a susceptible strain. DNA screening of moths captured from 23 field sites in six provinces of northern China revealed a 100-fold increase in the frequency of this mutation, from 0.001 in 2006 to 0.10 in 2016. The correspondence between the observed trajectory of the mutation and the trajectory predicted from simulation modeling shows that the dominance of the mutation accelerated adaptation. Proactive identification and tracking of the tetraspanin mutation demonstrate the potential for genomic analysis, gene editing, and molecular monitoring to improve management of resistance.},

            The large majority of variants identified by GWAS are non-coding, motivating detailed characterization of the function of non-coding variants. Experimental methods to assess variants’ effect on gene expressions in native chromatin context via direct perturbation are low-throughput. Existing high-throughput computational predictors thus have lacked large gold standard sets of regulatory variants for training and validation. Here, we leverage a set of 14,807 putative causal eQTLs in humans obtained through statistical fine-mapping, and we use 6121 features to directly train a predictor of whether a variant modifies nearby gene expression. We call the resulting prediction the expression modifier score (EMS). We validate EMS by comparing its ability to prioritize functional variants with other major scores. We then use EMS as a prior for statistical fine-mapping of eQTLs to identify an additional 20,913 putatively causal eQTLs, and we incorporate EMS into co-localization analysis to identify 310 additional candidate genes across UK Biobank phenotypes.},

	abstract = {Background:  Associational herbivore resistance is potentiated by neighbouring heterogenic plant species that impact a focal plant’s attraction to herbivores or the damage that they cause. One mechanism to confer associational resistance is believed to be exposure to neighbour-emitted volatiles, the receivers of which range from intra- and interspecific neighbour plants to higher-trophic-level insects. In previous studies the passive adsorption of neighbouremitted semivolatiles has been reported, but little is known regarding the mechanisms and ecological consequences on the receiver plant and its associated biota. To utilize volatile-based associational resistance for agricultural applications, it is imperative to know its effectiveness under varying diurnal temperatures and whether herbivore natural enemies, providing biological control, are impacted. Mimicking varying diurnal temperatures in a laboratory set-up, we assessed how the tritrophic model system Brassica oleracea var. italica (broccoli)–Plutella xylostella (crucifer specialist herbivore)–Cotesia vestalis (endoparasitoid of P. xylostella) is influenced by exposure to the natural semivolatile emitter plant Rhododendron tomentosum Harmaja.
Results:  Rhododendron tomentosum-exposed B. oleracea was less susceptible to P. xylostella oviposition at both night-time (12°C) and day-time (22°C) temperatures and less favoured and damaged by P. xylostella larvae at 12°C. Exposure did not interfere with indirect defence, i.e. attraction of the natural enemy C. vestalis on host-damaged, R. tomentosum-exposed B. oleracea under 22°C, while there was a reduction in attraction (marginal preference towards host-damaged B. oleracea) under 12°C.
Conclusions:  The ability of R. tomentosum exposure to render associational resistance against an agriculturally important Brassica herbivore P. xylostella without severely compromising the specialist parasitoid C. vestalis host location encourages further studies on the potential of using this naturally abundant plant for biocontrol. The generality of our finding on temperature as a potential regulating mechanism for the efficacy of semivolatile emitter-based associational resistance towards specialist pest larval damage should be further studied in natural and agricultural associations. Our study emphasizes the need to develop techniques to compare volatiles at the leaf versus air interface and associate their appearance and ecological role with times of activity and level of specialisation of herbivores and their natural enemies.},

              An increasing number of field studies have shown that the phenotype of an individual plant depends not only on its genotype but also on those of neighboring plants; however, this fact is not taken into consideration in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Based on the Ising model of ferromagnetism, we incorporated neighbor genotypic identity into a regression model, named “Neighbor GWAS”. Our simulations showed that the effective range of neighbor effects could be estimated using an observed phenotype when the proportion of phenotypic variation explained (PVE) by neighbor effects peaked. The spatial scale of the first nearest neighbors gave the maximum power to detect the causal variants responsible for neighbor effects, unless their effective range was too broad. However, if the effective range of the neighbor effects was broad and minor allele frequencies were low, there was collinearity between the self and neighbor effects. To suppress the false positive detection of neighbor effects, the fixed effect and variance components involved in the neighbor effects should be tested in comparison with a standard GWAS model. We applied neighbor GWAS to field herbivory data from 199 accessions of
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              and found that neighbor effects explained 8\% more of the PVE of the observed damage than standard GWAS. The neighbor GWAS method provides a novel tool that could facilitate the analysis of complex traits in spatially structured environments and is available as an R package at CRAN (
              https://cran.rproject.org/package=rNeighborGWAS

              Most diploid organisms have polyploid ancestors. The evolutionary process of polyploidization is poorly understood but has frequently been conjectured to involve some form of ‘genome shock’, such as genome reorganization and subgenome expression dominance. Here we study polyploidization in
              Arabidopsis suecica
              , a post-glacial allopolyploid species formed via hybridization of
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              and
              Arabidopsis arenosa
              . We generated a chromosome-level genome assembly of
              A. suecica
              and complemented it with polymorphism and transcriptome data from all species. Despite a divergence around 6 million years ago (Ma) between the ancestral species and differences in their genome composition, we see no evidence of a genome shock: the
              A. suecica
              genome is colinear with the ancestral genomes; there is no subgenome dominance in expression; and transposon dynamics appear stable. However, we find changes suggesting gradual adaptation to polyploidy. In particular, the
              A. thaliana
              subgenome shows upregulation of meiosis-related genes, possibly to prevent aneuploidy and undesirable homeologous exchanges that are observed in synthetic
              A. suecica
              , and the
              A. arenosa
              subgenome shows upregulation of cyto-nuclear processes, possibly in response to the new cytoplasmic environment of
              A. suecica
              , with plastids maternally inherited from
              A. thaliana
              . These changes are not seen in synthetic hybrids, and thus are likely to represent subsequent evolution.},

	abstract = {Excessive amounts of metal ions in soil are toxic for most plant species, yet metal can also facilitate plant survival by elemental defense against herbivores and pathogens. Zinc and cadmium hyperaccumulation in Arabidopsis halleri is known to be effective for the defense against natural enemies. The allotetraploid species A. kamchatica, derived from A. halleri and a nonhyperaccumulator A. lyrata, has a lower hyperaccumulation level of zinc than A. halleri, but its significance for elemental defense remains unknown. In this study, we evaluated the accumulation levels of zinc and cadmium in the allotetraploid compared with its diploid progenitors, and evaluated the contribution of metal treatments to anti-herbivore resistance under field conditions. The accumulation level of zinc in A. kamchatica was intermediate between the progenitors, but that of cadmium was lower than in both diploid progenitors. The elemental defense of A. kamchatica and A. halleri was supported by a field experiment comparing the herbivory level between a control group and metalsupplemented plants. Moreover, the effect of elemental defense was lower in A. kamchatica than in the hyperaccumulator progenitor A. halleri, which is consistent with the metal accumulation level. This result reveals that the allotetraploid plant inherited its hyperaccumulating ability from one progenitor as an advantageous trait but at an intermediate level.},

	abstract = {As part of a trend towards diversifying cultivated areas, varietal mixtures are subject to renewed interest as a means to manage diseases. Besides the epidemiological effects of varietal mixtures on pathogen propagation, little is known about the effect of intraspecific plant–plant interactions and their impact on responses to disease. In this study, genotypes of rice (Oryza sativa) or durum wheat (Triticum turgidum) were grown with different conspecific neighbours and manually inoculated under conditions preventing pathogen propagation. Disease susceptibility was measured together with the expression of basal immunity genes as part of the response to intra-specific neighbours. The results showed that in many cases for both rice and wheat susceptibility to pathogens and immunity was modified by the presence of intraspecific neighbours. This phenomenon, which we term ‘neighbour-modulated susceptibility’ (NMS), could be caused by the production of below-ground signals and does not require the neighbours to be infected. Our results suggest that the mechanisms responsible for reducing disease in varietal mixtures in the field need to be re-examined.},

              Due to large and complex genomes of Triticeae species, skim sequencing approaches have cost and analytical advantages for detecting genetic markers and building linkage maps. Here, we develop a high-density linkage map and identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for recombinant inbred lines of
              Aegilops tauschii
              , a D-genome donor of bread wheat, using the recently developed genotyping by Random Amplicon Sequencing-Direct (GRAS-Di) system, which facilitates skimming of the large and complicated genome and generates a large number of genetic markers. The deduced linkage groups based on the GRAS-Di genetic markers corresponded to the chromosome number of
              Ae. tauschii.
              We successfully identified stable QTLs for flowering time and spikelet shape-related traits. Genotype differences of RILs at the QTL-linked markers were significantly associated with the trait variations. In particular, one of the QTL-linked markers for flowering time was mapped close to
              VRN3
              (also known as
              FLOWERING LOCUS T
              ), which controls flowering. The GRAS-Di system is, therefore, an efficient and useful application for genotyping and linkage mapping in species with large and complex genomes, such as Triticeae species.},

	abstract = {Phenotypes of sessile organisms, such as plants, rely not only on their own genotypes but also on those of neighboring individuals. Previously, we incorporated such neighbor effects into a single-marker regression using the Ising model of ferromagnetism. However, little is known regarding how neighbor effects should be incorporated in quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. In this study, we propose a new method for interval QTL mapping of neighbor effects, designated “neighbor QTL,” the algorithm of which includes: (1) obtaining conditional self-genotype probabilities with recombination fraction between ﬂanking markers; (2) calculating conditional neighbor genotypic identity using the self-genotype probabilities; and (3) estimating additive and dominance deviations for neighbor effects. Our simulation using F2 and backcross lines showed that the power to detect neighbor effects increased as the effective range decreased. The neighbor QTL was applied to insect herbivory on Col Â Kas recombinant inbred lines of Arabidopsis thaliana. Consistent with previous results, the pilot experiment detected a self-QTL effect on the herbivory at the GLABRA1 locus. Regarding neighbor QTL effects on herbivory, we observed a weak QTL on the top of chromosome 4, at which a weak self-bolting QTL was also identiﬁed. The neighbor QTL method is available as an R package (https://cran.r-project.org/package¼rNeighborQTL), providing a novel tool to investigate neighbor effects in QTL studies.},

Recently, Ising/Potts models, also known as Markov random ﬁelds, have been productively applied to diverse problems in biology, including the prediction of structural contacts from protein sequence data and the description of neural activity patterns. However, inference of such models is a challenging computational problem that cannot be solved exactly. Here, we describe the adaptive cluster expansion (ACE) method to quickly and accurately infer Ising or Potts models based on correlation data. ACE avoids overﬁtting by constructing a sparse network of interactions sufﬁcient to reproduce the observed correlation data within the statistical error expected due to ﬁnite sampling. When convergence of the ACE algorithm is slow, we combine it with a Boltzmann Machine Learning algorithm (BML). We illustrate this method on a variety of biological and artiﬁcial datasets and compare it to state-of-theart approximate methods such as Gaussian and pseudo-likelihood inference.},

	abstract = {Epistasis, commonly defined as the interaction between multiple genes, is an important genetic component underlying phenotypic variation. Many statistical methods have been developed to model and identify epistatic interactions between genetic variants. However, because of the large combinatorial search space of interactions, most epistasis mapping methods face enormous computational challenges and often suffer from low statistical power due to multiple test correction. Here, we present a novel, alternative strategy for mapping epistasis: instead of directly identifying individual pairwise or higher-order interactions, we focus on mapping variants that have non-zero marginal epistatic effects—the combined pairwise interaction effects between a given variant and all other variants. By testing marginal epistatic effects, we can identify candidate variants that are involved in epistasis without the need to identify the exact partners with which the variants interact, thus potentially alleviating much of the statistical and computational burden associated with standard epistatic mapping procedures. Our method is based on a variance component model, and relies on a recently developed variance component estimation method for efficient parameter inference and p-value computation. We refer to our method as the “MArginal ePIstasis Test”, or MAPIT. With simulations, we show how MAPIT can be used to estimate and test marginal epistatic effects, produce calibrated test statistics under the null, and facilitate the detection of pairwise epistatic interactions. We further illustrate the benefits of MAPIT in a QTL mapping study by analyzing the gene expression data of over 400 individuals from the GEUVADIS consortium.},

	abstract = {Pine cones that remain closed and retain seeds until fire causes the cones to open (cone serotiny) represent a key adaptive trait in a variety of pine species. In lodgepole pine, there is substantial geographical variation in serotiny across the Rocky Mountain region. This variation in serotiny has evolved as a result of geographically divergent selection, with consequences that extend to forest communities and ecosystems. An understanding of the genetic architecture of this trait is of interest owing to the wide-reaching ecological consequences of serotiny and also because of the repeated evolution of the trait across the genus. Here, we present and utilize an inexpensive and time-effective method for generating population genomic data. The method uses restriction enzymes and PCR amplification to generate a library of fragments that can be sequenced with a high level of multiplexing. We obtained data for more than 95 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms across 98 serotinous and nonserotinous lodgepole pines from three populations. We used a Bayesian generalized linear model (GLM) to test for an association between genotypic variation at these loci and serotiny. The probability of serotiny varied by genotype at 11 loci, and the association between genotype and serotiny at these loci was consistent in each of the three populations of pines. Genetic variation across these 11 loci explained 50\% of the phenotypic variation in serotiny. Our results provide a first genome-wide association map of serotiny in pines and demonstrate an inexpensive and efficient method for generating population genomic data.},

              The identification and functional characterization of natural variants in plants are essential for understanding phenotypic adaptation. Here we identify a molecular variation in At2g47310 that contributes to the natural variation in flowering time in
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              accessions. This gene, which we term
              SISTER of FCA
              (
              SSF
              ), functions in an antagonistic manner to its close homolog FCA. Genome-wide association analysis screens two major haplotypes of SSF associated with the natural variation in
              FLC
              expression, and a single polymorphism, SSF-N414D, is identified as a main contributor. The SSF414N protein variant interacts more strongly with CUL1, a component of the E3 ubiquitination complex, than the SSF414D form, mediating differences in SSF protein degradation and
              FLC
              expression. FCA and SSF appear to have arisen through gene duplication after dicot-monocot divergence, with the SSF-N414D polymorphism emerging relatively recently within
              A. thaliana
              . This work provides a good example for deciphering the functional importance of natural polymorphisms in different organisms.},

The approach allows us to quantify the species’ effective couplings: Their frequencies exhibit a peak at zero and the minimal pairwise model is able to capture about 80\% of the ecosystem structure. Our analysis reveals a relatively stronger impact of the species network on uncommon species and underscores the importance of species pairs experiencing positive couplings.

In the case of associational resistance, habitat is modified to ameliorate stress, benefitting other organisms. The SGH is contentious due to conflicting evidence and theoretical perspectives, so we adopted a meta-­analytic approach to determine if it is widely supported across a variety of contexts, including different kingdoms, ecosystems, habitats, interactions, stressors, and life history stages. We developed an extensive list of Boolean search criteria to search the published ecological literature and successfully detect studies that both directly tested the hypothesis, and those that were relevant but never mentioned it. We found that the SGH is well supported by studies that feature bacteria, plants, terrestrial ecosystems, interspecific negative interactions, adults, survival instead of growth or reproduction, and drought, fire, and nutrient stress. We conclude that the SGH is indeed a broadly relevant ecological hypothesis that is currently held back by cross-­disciplinary communication barriers. More SGH research is needed beyond the scope of interspecific plant competition, and more SGH research should feature multifactor stress. There remains a need to account for positive interactions in scientific pursuits, such as associational resistance in tests of the SGH.},

	abstract = {In a local environment, plant networks include interactions among individuals of different species and among genotypes of the same species. While interspecific interactions are recognized as main drivers of plant community patterns, intraspecific interactions have recently gained attention in explaining plant community dynamics. However, an overview of intraspecific genotype-by-genotype interaction patterns within wild plant species is still missing. From the literature, we identified 91 experiments that were mainly designed to investigate the presence of positive interactions based on two contrasting hypotheses. Kin selection theory predicts partisan help given to a genealogical relative. The rationale behind this hypothesis relies on kin/non-kin recognition, with the positive outcome of kin cooperation substantiating it. On the other hand, the elbow-room hypothesis supports intraspecific niche partitioning leading to positive outcome when genetically distant genotypes interact. Positive diversity-productivity relationship rationalizes this hypothesis, notably with the outcome of overyielding. We found that both these hypotheses have been highly supported in experimental studies despite their opposite predictions between the extent of genetic relatedness among neighbors and the level of positive interactions. Interestingly, we identified a highly significant effect of breeding system, with a high proportion of selfing species associated with the presence of kin cooperation. Nonetheless, we identified several shortcomings regardless of the species considered, such as the lack of a reliable estimate of genetic relatedness among genotypes and ecological characterization of the natural habitats from which genotypes were collected, thereby impeding the identification of selective drivers of positive interactions. We therefore propose a framework combining evolutionary ecology and genomics to establish the eco-genomic landscape of positive GxG interactions in wild plant species.},

	abstract = {Jasmonates (JAs) orchestrate immune responses upon wound/herbivore injury or infection by necrotrophic pathogens. Elucidation of catabolic routes has revealed new complexity in jasmonate metabolism. Two integrated pathways attenuate signaling by turning over the active hormone jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) through u-oxidation or deconjugation, and deﬁne an indirect route forming the derivative 12OH-JA. Here, we provide evidence for a second 12OH-JA formation pathway by direct jasmonic acid (JA) oxidation. Three jasmonic acid oxidases (JAOs) of the 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase family catalyze speciﬁc oxidation of JA to 12OH-JA, and their genes are induced by wounding or infection by the fungus Botrytis cinerea. JAO2 exhibits the highest basal expression, and its deﬁciency in jao2 mutants strongly enhanced antifungal resistance. The resistance phenotype resulted from constitutive expression of antimicrobial markers rather than from their higher induction in infected jao2 plants and could be reversed by ectopic expression of any of the three JAOs in jao2. Elevated defense in jao2 was dependent on the activity of JASMONATE RESPONSE 1 (JAR1) and CORONATINE-INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1) but was not correlated with enhanced JA-Ile accumulation. Instead, jao2 mutant lines displayed altered accumulation of several JA species in healthy and challenged plants, suggesting elevated metabolic ﬂux through JA-Ile. Collectively, these data identify the missing enzymes hydroxylating JA and uncover an important metabolic diversion mechanism for repressing basal JA defense responses.},

              Natural environments require organisms to possess robust mechanisms allowing responses to seasonal trends. In

              , the flowering regulator
              AhgFLC
              shows upregulation and downregulation phases along with long-term past temperature, but the underlying machinery remains elusive. Here, we investigate the seasonal dynamics of histone modifications, H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, at
              AhgFLC
              in a natural population. Our advanced modelling and transplant experiments reveal that H3K27me3-mediated chromatin regulation at
              AhgFLC
              provides two essential properties. One is the ability to respond to the long-term temperature trends via bidirectional interactions between H3K27me3 and H3K4me3; the other is the ratchet-like character of the
              AhgFLC
              system, i.e. reversible in the entire perennial life cycle but irreversible during the upregulation phase. Furthermore, we show that the long-term temperature trends are locally indexed at
              AhgFLC
              in the form of histone modifications. Our study provides a more comprehensive understanding of H3K27me3 function at

Although the beneﬁts of feedback between theoretical and empirical research are widely acknowledged by ecologists, this link is still not as strong as it could be in ecological research. This is in part because theory, particularly when expressed mathematically, can feel inaccessible to empiricists who may have little formal training in advanced math. To address this persistent barrier, we provide a general and accessible guide that covers the basic, step-by-step process of how to approach, understand, and use ecological theory in empirical work. We ﬁrst give an overview of how and why mathematical theory is created, then outline four speciﬁc ways to use both mathematical and verbal theory to motivate empirical work, and ﬁnally present a practical tool kit for reading and understanding the mathematical aspects of ecological theory. We hope that empowering empiricists to embrace theory in their work will help move the ﬁeld closer to a full integration of theoretical and empirical research.},

	abstract = {Genetic manipulation of plant volatile emissions is a promising tool to enhance plant defences against herbivores. However, the potential costs associated with the manipulation of speciﬁc volatile synthase genes are unknown. Therefore, we investigated the physiological and ecological effects of transforming a maize line with a terpene synthase gene in ﬁeld and laboratory assays, both above- and below ground. The transformation, which resulted in the constitutive emission of (E)-b-caryophyllene and a-humulene, was found to compromise seed germination, plant growth and yield. These physiological costs provide a possible explanation for the inducibility of an (E)-b-caryophyllene-synthase gene in wild and cultivated maize. The overexpression of the terpene synthase gene did not impair plant resistance nor volatile emission. However, constitutive terpenoid emission increased plant apparency to herbivores, including adults and larvae of the above ground pest Spodoptera frugiperda, resulting in an increase in leaf damage. Although terpenoid overproducing lines were also attractive to the specialist root herbivore Diabrotica virgifera virgifera below ground, they did not suffer more root damage in the ﬁeld, possibly because of the enhanced attraction of entomopathogenic nematodes. Furthermore, fewer adults of the root herbivore Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardii were found to emerge near plants that emitted (E)-b-caryophyllene and a-humulene. Yet, overall, under the given ﬁeld conditions, the costs of constitutive volatile production overshadowed its beneﬁts. This study highlights the need for a thorough assessment of the physiological and ecological consequences of genetically engineering plant signals in the ﬁeld to determine the potential of this approach for sustainable pest management strategies.},

In this review, we critically evaluate current knowledge on the toxicity of volatiles to fungi, bacteria, and viruses and their role in plant resistance as well as how they act to induce systemic resistance in uninfected parts of the plant and in neighbouring plants. We also discuss how microbes can detoxify plant volatiles and exploit them as nutrients, attractants for insect vectors, and inducers of volatile emissions, which stimulate immune responses that make plants more susceptible to infection. Although much more is known about plant volatile–herbivore interactions, knowledge of volatile–microbe interactions is growing and it may eventually be possible to harness plant volatiles to reduce disease in agriculture and forestry. Future research in this field can be facilitated by making use of the analytical and molecular tools generated by the prolific research on plant–herbivore interactions.},

            As sessile organisms, plants are subjected to fluctuating sunlight including potentially detrimental ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B). In
            Arabidopsis thaliana
            , experiments under controlled conditions have shown that
            UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8
            (
            UVR8
            ) controls photomorphogenic responses for acclimation and tolerance to UV-B; however, its long-term impacts on plant performance remain poorly understood in naturally fluctuating environments. Here we quantified the survival and reproduction of different
            Arabidopsis
            mutant genotypes in diverse field and laboratory conditions. We found that
            uvr8
            mutants produced more fruits than wild type in growth chambers with artificial low UV-B conditions but not in natural field conditions. Importantly, independent double mutants of
            UVR8
            and the blue-light photoreceptor gene
            CRYPTOCHROME 1
            (
            CRY1
            ) in two genetic backgrounds showed a drastic reduction in fitness in the field. UV-B attenuation experiments in field conditions and supplemental UV-B in growth chambers demonstrated that UV-B caused the conditional
            cry1 uvr8
            lethality phenotype. RNA sequencing in different conditions revealed a large number of genes with statistical interaction of
            UVR8

            mutations in the presence of UV-B in the field. Among them, Gene Ontology analysis identified enrichment of categories related to UV-B response, oxidative stress, photoprotection and DNA damage repair. Our study demonstrates the functional importance of the

	abstract = {Background: Vietnam possesses a vast diversity of rice landraces due to its geographical situation, latitudinal range, and a variety of ecosystems. This genetic diversity constitutes a highly valuable resource at a time when the highest rice production areas in the low-lying Mekong and Red River Deltas are enduring increasing threats from climate changes, particularly in rainfall and temperature patterns.
Results: We analysed 672 Vietnamese rice genomes, 616 newly sequenced, that encompass the range of rice varieties grown in the diverse ecosystems found throughout Vietnam. We described four Japonica and five Indica subpopulations within Vietnam likely adapted to the region of origin. We compared the population structure and genetic diversity of these Vietnamese rice genomes to the 3000 genomes of Asian cultivated rice. The named Indica-5 (I5) subpopulation was expanded in Vietnam and contained lowland Indica accessions, which had very low shared ancestry with accessions from any other subpopulation and were previously overlooked as admixtures. We scored phenotypic measurements for nineteen traits and identified 453 unique genotype-phenotype significant associations comprising twenty-one QTLs (quantitative trait loci). The strongest associations were observed for grain size traits, while weaker associations were observed for a range of characteristics, including panicle length, heading date and leaf width.
Conclusions: We showed how the rice diversity within Vietnam relates to the wider Asian rice diversity by using a number of approaches to provide a clear picture of the novel diversity present within Vietnam, mainly around the Indica-5 subpopulation. Our results highlight differences in genome composition and trait associations among traditional Vietnamese rice accessions, which are likely the product of adaption to multiple environmental conditions and regional preferences in a very diverse country. Our results highlighted traits and their associated genomic regions that are a potential source of novel loci and alleles to breed a new generation of low input sustainable and climate resilient rice.},

	abstract = {Background: While a multitude of genotyping platforms have been developed for rice, the majority of them have not been optimized for breeding where cost, turnaround time, throughput and ease of use, relative to density and informativeness are critical parameters of their utility. With that in mind we report the development of the 1K-Rice Custom Amplicon, or 1k-RiCA, a robust custom sequencing-based amplicon panel of {\textasciitilde} 1000-SNPs that are uniformly distributed across the rice genome, designed to be highly informative within indica rice breeding pools, and tailored for genomic prediction in elite indica rice breeding programs.
Results: Empirical validation tests performed on the 1k-RiCA showed average marker call rates of 95\% with marker repeatability and concordance rates of 99\%. These technical properties were not affected when two common DNA extraction protocols were used. The average distance between SNPs in the 1k-RiCA was 1.5 cM, similar to the theoretical distance which would be expected between 1,000 uniformly distributed markers across the rice genome. The average minor allele frequencies on a panel of indica lines was 0.36 and polymorphic SNPs estimated on pairwise comparisons between indica by indica accessions and indica by japonica accessions were on average 430 and 450 respectively. The specific design parameters of the 1k-RiCA allow for a detailed view of genetic relationships and unambiguous molecular IDs within indica accessions and good cost vs. marker-density balance for genomic prediction applications in elite indica germplasm. Predictive abilities of Genomic Selection models for flowering time, grain yield, and plant height were on average 0.71, 0.36, and 0.65 respectively based on crossvalidation analysis. Furthermore the inclusion of important trait markers associated with 11 different genes and QTL adds value to parental selection in crossing schemes and marker-assisted selection in forward breeding applications.
Conclusions: This study validated the marker quality and robustness of the 1k-RiCA genotypic platform for genotyping populations derived from indica rice subpopulation for genetic and breeding purposes including MAS and genomic selection. The 1k-RiCA has proven to be an alternative cost-effective genotyping system for breeding applications.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Genetic association studies have explained only a small proportion of the estimated heritability of complex traits, leaving the remaining heritability “missing.” Genetic interactions have been proposed as an explanation for this, because they lead to overestimates of the heritability and are hard to detect. Whether this explanation is true depends on the proportion of variance attributable to genetic interactions, which is difficult to measure in outbred populations. Founder populations exhibit a greater range of kinship than outbred populations, which helps in fitting the epistatic variance. We extend classic theory to founder populations, giving the covariance between individuals due to epistasis of any order. We recover the classic theory as a limit, and we derive a recently proposed estimator of the narrow sense heritability as a corollary. We extend the variance decomposition to include dominance. We show in simulations that it would be possible to estimate the variance from pairwise interactions with samples of a few thousand from strongly bottlenecked human founder populations, and we provide an analytical approximation of the standard error. Applying these methods to 46 traits measured in a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cross, we estimate that pairwise interactions explain 10\% of the phenotypic variance on average and that third- and higher-order interactions explain 14\% of the phenotypic variance on average. We search for third-order interactions, discovering an interaction that is shared between two traits. Our methods will be relevant to future studies of epistatic variance in founder populations and crosses.},

This primarily human-driven loss of biodiversity has unprecedented negative consequences for ecosystems and people. Classic and emerging approaches in genetics and genomics have the potential to dramatically improve these outcomes. In particular, the study of interactions among genetic loci within and between species will play a critical role in understanding the adaptive potential of species and communities, and hence their direct and indirect effects on biodiversity, ecosystems and people. We explore these population and community genomic contexts in the hope of finding solutions for maintaining and improving ecosystem services and nature’s contributions to people.},

We present a framework based on multilevel selection for evaluating evolutionary change from individuals to communities, with supporting empirical evidence. Essential to this evaluation is the role that interspecific indirect genetic effects play in shaping community organization, in generating variation among community phenotypes, and in creating community heritability. If communities vary in phenotype, and those phenotypes are heritable and subject to selection at multiple levels, then a community view of evolution must be merged with mainstream evolutionary theory. Rapid environmental change during the Anthropocene will require a better understanding of these evolutionary processes, especially selection acting at the community level, which has the potential to eliminate whole communities while favoring others.},

	abstract = {Understanding the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has major implications. Biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships are generally investigated at the interspeciﬁc level, although intraspeciﬁc diversity (i.e. within-species diversity) is increasingly perceived as an important ecological facet of biodiversity. Here, we provide a quantitative and integrative synthesis testing, across diverse plant and animal species, whether intraspeciﬁc diversity is a major driver of community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. We speciﬁcally tested (i) whether the number of genotypes/phenotypes (i.e. intraspeciﬁc richness) or the speciﬁc identity of genotypes/phenotypes (i.e. intraspeciﬁc variation) in populations modulate the structure of communities and the functioning of ecosystems, (ii) whether the ecological effects of intraspeciﬁc richness and variation are strong in magnitude, and (iii) whether these effects vary among taxonomic groups and ecological responses. We found a non-linear relationship between intraspeciﬁc richness and community and ecosystem dynamics that follows a saturating curve shape, as observed for biodiversity–function relationships measured at the interspeciﬁc level. Importantly, intraspeciﬁc richness modulated ecological dynamics with a magnitude that was equal to that previously reported for interspeciﬁc richness. Our results further conﬁrm, based on a database containing more than 50 species, that intraspeciﬁc variation also has substantial effects on ecological dynamics. We demonstrated that the effects of intraspeciﬁc variation are twice as high as expected by chance, and that they might have been underestimated previously. Finally, we found that the ecological effects of intraspeciﬁc variation are not homogeneous and are actually stronger when intraspeciﬁc variation is manipulated in primary producers than in consumer species, and when they are measured at the ecosystem rather than at the community level. Overall, we demonstrated that the two facets of intraspeciﬁc diversity (richness and variation) can both strongly affect community and ecosystem dynamics, which reveals the pivotal role of within-species biodiversity for understanding ecological dynamics.},

We hypothesised that branch-­localised defence induction and vertical stratification in mature oaks constitute sources of chemical variation that extend across trophic levels. To test this, we combined manipulation of plant defences, predation monitoring, food-­choice trials with herbivores and sampling of herbivore assemblages. Both induction and vertical stratification affected branch chemistry, but the effect of induction was stronger. Induction increased predation in the canopy and reduced herbivory in bioassays. The effects of increased predation affected herbivore assemblages by decreasing their abundance, and indirectly, their richness. In turn, we show that there are multiple factors contributing to variation across canopies. Branch-­localised induction, variation between tree individuals and predation may be the ones with particularly strong effects on diverse assemblages of insects in temperate forests.},

	abstract = {A null model for habitat patch selection in spatially heterogeneous environments is the ideal free distribution (IFD), which assumes individuals have complete knowledge about the environment and can freely disperse. Under equilibrium conditions, the IFD predicts that local population growth rates are zero in all occupied patches, sink patches are unoccupied, and the fraction of the population selecting a patch is proportional to the patch’s carrying capacity. Individuals, however, often experience stochastic ﬂuctuations in environmental conditions and cannot respond to these ﬂuctuations instantaneously. An evolutionary stability analysis for ﬁxed patch-selection strategies reveals that environmental uncertainty disrupts the classical IFD predictions: individuals playing the evolutionarily stable strategy may occupy sink patches, local growth rates are negative and typically unequal in all patches, and individuals prefer higher-quality patches less than predicted by their carrying capacities. Spatial correlations in environmental ﬂuctuations can enhance or marginalize these trends. The analysis predicts that continually increasing environmental variation ﬁrst selects for range expansion, then selects for persisting coupled sink populations, and ultimately leads to regional extinction. In contrast, continually increasing habitat degradation ﬁrst selects for range contraction and may select for persisting coupled sink populations before regional extinction. These results highlight the combined roles of spatial and temporal heterogeneity on the evolution of habitat selection.},

However, settling densities of females were not correlated with odonate emergence rates on individual territories or on individual territories plus adjacent ones. Apparently, females assessed production of insects on breeding marshes at the time they settled, and they used this information when making settling decisions. However, they selected nest sites on the basis of vegetation density rather than food availability. The complexity of decision making by female yellowheads would not have been detected had our analysis been restricted to one spatial scale. Because interpretations of habitat selection behavior are scale-dependent, careful attention to scale and performing analyses on more than one spatial scale are essential in studies of habitat selection.},

	abstract = {Habitat selection is the disproportionate use of available conditions and resources, and involves responses in space and time to perceived risks and rewards. It frequently depends on the scale of measurement, often in non-linear ways that preclude simple extrapolation across scales. More critically, animals often select different habitat components at different scales, and species vary in their scales of selection. Although multi-scaled research on habitat selection has proliferated, synthesis of this work has been impeded by imprecise terminology and arbitrarily defined analytical scales. Here, we review key concepts and findings and evaluate future prospects opened up in part by new technologies that enable novel and more efficient data collection. Innovative measurement, combined with novel analytical approaches, permits habitat selection to be investigated across a broad continuum of scales. By linking habitat selection to fitness as a function of scale, use-of-habitat assessments can be more effective. The fitness costs and benefits of habitat selection change with scale; the scales of habitat selection may inform us of limiting factors. We outline how reward/risk ratios can be used to assess the fitness implications of habitat selection across scales.},

To estimate these quantities, we allowed spontaneous mutations to accumulate for 10 generations in 1,000 inbred lines of the annual, self-fertilizing plant Arabidopsis thaliana and assayed fitness differences between generations 0 and 10 in a common garden. Germination rate, fruit set, and number of seeds per fruit each declined by less than 1\% per generation in the mutation lines, and total fitness declined by 0.9\% per generation. Among-line variances increased in the mutation lines for all traits. Application of an equal-effects model suggests a downwardly biased genomic deleterious mutation rate of 0.1 and a upwardly biased effect of individual mutations on total fitness of 20\%. This genomic deleterious mutation rate is consistent with estimates of nucleotide substitution rates in f lowering plants, the genome size of Arabidopsis, and the equilibrium inbreeding depression observed in this highly selfing plant species.},

Both the mean number of pollengrainsper flower and the pollen-ovule ratio weresignificantly larger in the allogamous taxa than in the autogamous taxa, whereas the mean number of ovules per flower was not significantly different. However, the pollen-ovule ratio was found to be a much better indicator of the breedingsystem than the mean number of pollengrains by itself, based on the degree of overlap between the valuesfor the allogamous and autogamous taxa. Variation in the amount of pollen produced by different sets of stamens and a correlation between the pollen-ovule ratio and seed size were identified as potential sources of error in calculating and interpretingthe pollen-ovule ratios. This survey suggests that the pollen-ovule ratios of allogamouscrucifers are typically greaterthan 3,500, that those of autogamous crucifers are typically less than 1,000, and that these standards can be used for indicating the breeding systems of other species in the Cruciferae.},

Flower size, flower shape, herkogamy levels, P/O ratio, and floral integration of six self-incompatible (outcrossing) and six self-compatible (selfing) populations of A. lyrata were measured in a common environment using conventional and geometric morphometrics methods. Although selfers had on average 9.2\% smaller corollas, 8.4\% longer pistils, and 21.5\% lower P/O ratios than outcrossers, there were no differences in shape, floral integration, and herkogamy between outcrossing and selfing populations. Moreover, most variation in floral traits was explained by population genetic background rather than by mating system. We conclude that selfing populations in A. lyrata have not evolved a selfing syndrome.},

	abstract = {The consumption of plants by animals underlies important evolutionary and ecological processes in nature. Arthropod herbivory evolved approximately 415 Ma and the ensuing coevolution between plants and herbivores is credited with generating much of the macroscopic diversity on the Earth. In contemporary ecosystems, herbivory provides the major conduit of energy from primary producers to consumers. Here, we show that when averaged across all major lineages of vascular plants, herbivores consume 5.3\% of the leaf tissue produced annually by plants, whereas previous estimates are up to 3.8× higher. This result suggests that for many plant species, leaf herbivory may play a smaller role in energy and nutrient flow than currently thought. Comparative analyses of a diverse global sample of 1058 species across 2085 populations reveal that models of stabilizing selection best describe rates of leaf consumption, and that rates vary substantially within and among major plant lineages. A key determinant of this variation is plant growth form, where woody plant species experience 64\% higher leaf herbivory than non-woody plants. Higher leaf herbivory in woody species supports a key prediction of the plant apparency theory. Our study provides insight into how a long history of coevolution has shaped the ecological and evolutionary relationships between plants and herbivores.},

	abstract = {Plants need to cope with changing environmental conditions, be it variable light or temperature, different availability of water or nutrients, or attack by pathogens or insects. Some of these changing conditions can become stressful and require strong countermeasures to ensure plant survival. Plants have evolved numerous distinct sensing and signalling mechanisms to perceive and respond appropriately to a variety of stresses. Because of the unpredictable nature of numerous stresses, resource‐saving stress response mechanisms are inducible and become activated only upon a stress experience. Furthermore, plants have evolved mechanisms by which they can remember past stress events and prime their responses in order to react more rapidly or more strongly to recurrent stress. Research over the last decade has revealed mechanisms of this information storage and retrieval, which include epigenetic regulation, transcriptional priming, primed conformation of proteins, or specific hormonal or metabolic signatures. There is also increasing understanding of the ecological constraints and relevance of stress priming and memory. This special issue presents research articles and reviews addressing various aspects of this exciting and growing field of research. Here, we introduce the topic by referring to the articles published in this issue, and we outline open questions and future directions of research.},

Several putative transcriptional regulators are known to inﬂuence this cell fate decision. Indirect evidence from studies with the maize R gene has been used to suggest that a bHLH transcription factor also participates in this process. We show that two Arabidopsis genes encoding bHLH proteins, GLABRA3 (GL3) and ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 (EGL3), act in a partially redundant manner to specify root epidermal cell fates. Plants homozygous for mutations in both genes fail to specify the non-hair cell type, whereas plants overexpressing either gene produce ectopic non-hair cells. We also ﬁnd that these genes are required for appropriate transcription of the non-hair speciﬁcation gene GL2 and the hair cell speciﬁcation gene CPC, showing that GL3 and EGL3 inﬂuence both epidermal cell fates. Furthermore, we show that these bHLH proteins require a functional WER MYB protein for their action, and they physically interact with WER and CPC in the yeast two-hybrid assay. These results suggest a model in which GL3 and EGL3 act together with WER in the N cell position to promote the non-hair cell fate, whereas they interact with the incomplete MYB protein CPC in the H position, which blocks the non-hair pathway and leads to the hair cell fate.},

The mutant nuclei consist of many interconnected lobes; however, only a single set of polytene-like chromosomes reside in the mutant nuclei. The predicted gl3-sst polypeptide has a Leu to Phe substitution (codon 78) within a region responsible for protein-protein interaction. Yeast interaction assays comparing GL3 with gl3-sst proteins show that the mutant protein interaction with GL1 and TTG1 is decreased by 75\% and 50\%, respectively, but there is no difference in its interaction with TRY.

            The development of trichomes (leaf hairs) from pluripotent epidermal cells in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) provides a powerful system to investigate the regulatory motifs involved in plant cell differentiation. We show here that trichome initiation is triggered within 4 h of the induction of the GLABRA3 (GL3) basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. Within this developmental window, GL3 binds to the promoters of at least three genes previously implicated in the development and patterning of trichomes (GL2, CAPRICE, and ENHANCER OF TRIPTYCHON AND CAPRICE1) and activates their transcription. The in vivo binding of GL3 to the promoters of these genes requires the presence of the R2R3-MYB factor GL1, supporting a model in which a GL3-GL1 complex is part of the trichome initiation enhanceosome. In contrast, GL3 is recruited to its own promoter in a GL1-independent manner, and this results in decreased GL3 expression, suggesting the presence of a GL3 negative autoregulatory loop. In support of genetic analyses indicating that ENHANCER OF GL3 (EGL3) is partially redundant with GL3, we show that EGL3 shares some direct targets with GL3. However, our results suggest that GL3 and EGL3 work independently of each other. Taken together, our results provide a regulatory framework to understand early events of epidermal cell differentiation.},

Furthermore, the idd4 mutant exhibits enhanced plant-growth indicating IDD4 as suppressor of growth and development. Transcriptome comparison of idd4 mutants and IDD4ox lines aligned to genome-wide IDD4 DNA-binding studies revealed major target genes related to defense and developmentalbiological processes. IDD4 is a phospho-protein that interacts and becomes phosphorylated on two conserved sites by the MAP kinase MPK6. DNA-binding studies of IDD4 after flg22 treatment and with IDD4 phosphosite mutants show enhanced binding affinity to ID1 motifcontaining promoters and its function as a transcriptional regulator. In contrast to the IDD4phospho-dead mutant, the IDD4 phospho-mimicking mutant shows altered susceptibility to PstDC3000, salicylic acid levels and transcriptome reprogramming. In summary, we found that IDD4 regulates various hormonal pathways thereby coordinating growth and development with basal immunity.},

              Since the first half of the twentieth century, evolutionary theory has been dominated by the idea that mutations occur randomly with respect to their consequences
              1
              . Here we test this assumption with large surveys of de novo mutations in the plant
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              . In contrast to expectations, we find that mutations occur less often in functionally constrained regions of the genome—mutation frequency is reduced by half inside gene bodies and by two-thirds in essential genes. With independent genomic mutation datasets, including from the largest
              Arabidopsis
              mutation accumulation experiment conducted to date, we demonstrate that epigenomic and physical features explain over 90\% of variance in the genome-wide pattern of mutation bias surrounding genes. Observed mutation frequencies around genes in turn accurately predict patterns of genetic polymorphisms in natural
              Arabidopsis
              accessions (
              r
               = 0.96). That mutation bias is the primary force behind patterns of sequence evolution around genes in natural accessions is supported by analyses of allele frequencies. Finally, we find that genes subject to stronger purifying selection have a lower mutation rate. We conclude that epigenome-associated mutation bias
              2
              reduces the occurrence of deleterious mutations in
              Arabidopsis

	abstract = {Our current, empirical understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function is based on two information sources. First, controlled experiments which show generally positive relationships. Second, observational field data which show variable relationships. This latter source coupled with a lack of observed declines in local biodiversity has led to the argument that biodiversity-­ ecosystem functioning relationships may be uninformative for conservation and management. We review ecological theory and re-­analyse several biodiversity datasets to argue that ecosystem function correlations with local diversity in observational field data are often difficult to interpret in the context of biodiversity-­ ecosystem function research. This occurs because biotic interactions filter species during community assembly which means that there can be a high biodiversity effect on functioning even with low observed local diversity. Our review indicates that we should not necessarily expect any specific relationship between local biodiversity and ecosystem function in observational field data. Rather, linking predictions from biodiversity-­ecosystem function theory and experiments to observational field data requires considering the pool of species available during colonisation: the local species pool. We suggest that, even without local biodiversity declines, biodiversity loss at regional scales—­which determines local species pools—­may still negatively affect ecosystem functioning.},

	abstract = {The order Coleoptera (beetles) is arguably the most speciose group of animals, but the evolutionary history of beetles, including the impacts of plant feeding (herbivory) on beetle diversification, remain poorly understood. We inferred the phylogeny of beetles using 4,818 genes for 146 species, estimated timing and rates of beetle diversification using 89 genes for 521 species representing all major lineages and traced the evolution of beetle genes enabling symbiont-independent digestion of lignocellulose using 154 genomes or transcriptomes. Phylogenomic analyses of these uniquely comprehensive datasets resolved previously controversial beetle relationships, dated the origin of Coleoptera to the Carboniferous, and supported the codiversification of beetles and angiosperms. Moreover, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) obtained from bacteria and fungi via horizontal gene transfers may have been key to the Mesozoic diversification of herbivorous beetles—remarkably, both major independent origins of specialized herbivory in beetles coincide with the first appearances of an arsenal of PCWDEs encoded in their genomes. Furthermore, corresponding (Jurassic) diversification rate increases suggest that these novel genes triggered adaptive radiations that resulted in nearly half of all living beetle species. We propose that PCWDEs enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, facilitating the evolution of uniquely specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring. Beetle diversity thus appears to have resulted from multiple factors, including low extinction rates over a long evolutionary history, codiversification with angiosperms, and adaptive radiations of specialized herbivorous beetles following convergent horizontal transfers of microbial genes encoding PCWDEs.},

	abstract = {We summarize work on a speciose Neotropical tree genus, Inga (Fabaceae), examining how interspecific variation in antiherbivore defenses may have evolved, how defenses shape host choice by herbivores and how they might regulate community composition and influence species radiations. Defenses of expanding leaves include secondary metabolites, extrafloral nectaries, rapid leaf expansion, trichomes, and synchrony and timing of leaf production. These six classes of defenses are orthogonal, supporting independent evolutionary trajectories. Moreover, only trichomes show a phylogenetic signature, suggesting evolutionary lability in nearly all defenses. The interspecific diversity in secondary metabolite profiles does not arise from the evolution of novel compounds, but from novel combinations of common compounds, presumably due to changes in gene regulation. Herbivore host choice is determined by plant defensive traits, not host phylogeny. Neighboring plants escape each other’s pests if their defenses differ enough, thereby enforcing the high local diversity typical of tropical forests. Related herbivores feed on hosts with similar defenses, implying that there are phylogenetic constraints placed on the herbivore traits that are associated with host use. Divergence in defensive traits among Inga appears to be driven by herbivore pressure. However, the lack of congruence between herbivore and host phylogeny suggests that herbivores are tracking defenses, choosing hosts based on traits for which they already have adaptations. There is, therefore, an asymmetry in the host–herbivore evolutionary arms race.},

Individual VOCs can be directly toxic or deterrent, serve as signal molecules to attract natural enemies, and/or be perceived by distal plant tissues as a priming signal to prepare for expected herbivory. Environmental conditions, as well as the specific plant–insect interaction being investigated, strongly influence the observed functions of VOC blends. The complexity of plant–insect chemical communication via VOCs is further enriched by the sophisticated molecular perception mechanisms of insects, which can respond to one or more VOCs and thereby influence insect behavior in a manner that has yet to be fully elucidated. Despite numerous gaps in the current understanding of VOC-mediated plant–insect interactions, successful pest management strategies such as push–pull systems, synthetic odorant traps, and crop cultivars with modified VOC profiles have been developed to supplement chemical pesticide applications and enable more sustainable agricultural practices. Future studies in this field would benefit from examining the responses of both plants and insects in the same experiment to gain a more complete view of these interactive systems. Furthermore, a molecular evolutionary study of key genetic elements of the ecological interaction phenotypes could provide new insights into VOC-mediated plant communication with insect herbivores.},

	abstract = {The selection of ideotypes combining high biomass production, high water use efficiency (WUE) and adequate wood properties is a major challenge in improving forest trees for industrial plantations. This issue was addressed in a field experiment evaluating 1130 clones of Eucalyptus urophylla * Eucalyptus grandis. Genomic selection using 3303 SNPs and the GBLUP model was carried out at age 55 months to select genitors and clones for stem volume (V55), WUE (using stable carbon isotope composition in stemwood, δ13C as a proxy, transformed into intrinsic WUE, Wi), as well as lignin (KL) and holocellulose (HCEL) contents. The variance components were mainly additive for δ13C(Wi), KL and HCEL, while they were highly non-additive for V55 (the ratio of dominance to additive variance was 130\%). The narrow sense heritability was higher for Wi (h2 = 0.704) than for volume and wood traits ({\textless} 0.5), showing that this trait was under strong genetic control. Additive and total genetic correlations among traits were low (between −0.260 and 0.260) as were the correlations due to environmental effects (between −0.267 and 0.344), which suggests a rather independence among traits. The equal emphasis and the desired gain index selection methods were used to assess economic weights and to estimate the expected additive and total genetic gains. Different breeding objectives were defined with percentages weighting the economic coefficients or the desired gain for the equal emphasis or desired gain method, respectively. When the breeding objective gave emphasis to volume production using the percentages of 70\%, 10\%, 10\%, and 10\% for V55, HCEL, KL and Wi, respectively, positive gains were observed in both methods, but the correlation between index rankings were 0.686 and 0.635 for breeding and clonal selection, respectively. With a more balanced breeding objective using percentages such as 25\%, 25\%, 25\%, 25\% for V55, HCEL, KL and Wi, respectively, both index methods gave close positive gains and similar rankings, the correlation between index rankings ranging from 0.941 to 0.982 for parent selection and from 0.883 to 0.903 for clone selection. With more contrasted percentages between V55 and Wi, such as (80\%, 10\%, 10\%, 0\%) or (90\%, 10\%, 10\%, −10\%), the gain increased for V55 and was close to the maximum and decreased markedly for Wi. This study explores the magnitude of economic coefficients for index selection and shows that positive genetic gains can be achieved by associating biomass, a proxy of WUE and wood chemical traits. It provides encouraging results for selecting Eucalyptus varieties adapted to dry zones while maintaining good performances regarding other economic traits.},

Little work has been done to characterize the broader genomic basis of herbicide resistance, including the number and distribution of genes involved, their effect sizes, allele frequencies and signatures of selection. In this work, we implemented genome-­wide association (GWA) and population genomic approaches to examine the genetic architecture of glyphosate (Round-­up) resistance in the problematic agricultural weed Amaranthus tuberculatus. A GWA was able to correctly identify the known target-­gene but statistically controlling for two causal target-­site mechanisms revealed an additional 250 genes across all 16 chromosomes associated with non-­target-­site resistance (NTSR). The encoded proteins had functions that have been linked to NTSR, the most significant of which is response to chemicals, but also showed pleiotropic roles in reproduction and growth. Compared to an empirical null that accounts for complex population structure, the architecture of NTSR was enriched for large effect sizes and low allele frequencies, suggesting the role of pleiotropic constraints on its evolution. The enrichment of rare alleles also suggested that the genetic architecture of NTSR may be population-­specific and heterogeneous across the range. Despite their rarity, we found signals of recent positive selection on NTSR-­alleles by both window-­and haplotype-­based statistics, and an enrichment of amino acid changing variants. In our samples, genome-­wide single nucleotide polymorphisms explain a comparable amount of the total variation in glyphosate resistance to monogenic mechanisms, even in a collection of individuals where 80\% of resistant individuals have large-­effect TSR mutations, indicating an underappreciated polygenic contribution to the evolution of herbicide resistance in weed populations.},

            Plant defense responses against insect herbivores are induced through wound-induced signaling and the specific perception of herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs). In addition, herbivores can deliver effectors that suppress plant immunity. Here we review plant immune recognition of HAMPs and effectors, and argue that these initial molecular interactions upon a plant-herbivore encounter mediate and structure effective resistance. While the number of distinct HAMPs and effectors from both chewing and piercing-sucking herbivores has expanded rapidly with omics-enabled approaches, paired receptors and targets in the host are still not well characterized. Herbivore-derived effectors may also be recognized as HAMPs depending on the host plant species, potentially through the evolution of novel immune receptor functions. We compile examples of HAMPs and effectors where natural variation between species may inform evolutionary patterns and mechanisms of plant-herbivore interactions. Finally, we discuss the combined effects of wounding and HAMP recognition, and review potential signaling hubs, which may integrate both sensing functions. Understanding the precise mechanisms for plant sensing of herbivores will be critical for engineering resistance in agriculture.},

Experiments on grasshoppers show that there is a signiﬁcant time cost in having to make a choice, relative to situations in which individuals have grown accustomed to having no choice. Those with a choice were shown to be less decisive by two different measures than those without a choice. It is argued that the data, showing lengthy decision times as a result of having a choice, would involve a signiﬁcant ecological risk. It is further argued that the reduced risk of quick decisions would favor specialization of resource use. The evolution of resource-speciﬁc cues that have often been called sign stimuli are considered critical elements of restricted resource use.},

The specialists' mechanisms for improved efficiency are discussed as well as some of the processes that may be selected to increase processing efficiency in generalists. The fitness consequences of differences in efficiency of specialists and generalists are pointed out. One of the major disadvantages for generalists is the increase in vulnerability to ecological risks, especially risks imposed by various natural enemies. Efficiency-related factors are indicated as previously underestimated elements that could influence host affiliations including diet breadth and changes in host plant use.},

We modelled this in three steps. First, we analysed conditions for selection for defended, signalling plants, in a population of undefended plants. Second, we analysed conditions for when mimicking plants can invade a population of defended, signalling plants, leading to a stable equilibrium between the two strategies. Third, we analysed how sampling of signalling plants by herbivores aects the equilibrium between the strategies. The predictions show that mimicry of plant defence signals may be common, and even imperfect mimics could invade a population of defended, signalling plants. Whether the latter prediction holds or not depends on how herbivores generalize over signals, and on the length of their `avoidance sequence'. The length of the avoidance sequence is the number of signalling plants that a herbivore avoids to attack, after attacking a defended plant. If herbivores always sample signalling plants, then mimicry cannot evolve, whereas if herbivores have a long avoidance sequence, this may allow selection even for imperfect mimics.},

	abstract = {Natural plant populations exhibit genetic variation in defense traits against herbivores. Despite a growing body of evidence for herbivore-mediated selection on plant defenses, we still know little about how genetic variation persists in antiherbivore defense traits. Here we present field and experimental evidence for herbivore-mediated frequency-dependent selection that promotes the maintenance of trichome-producing (hairy) and trichomeless (glabrous) plants of Arabidopsis halleri subsp. gemmifera. First, in a natural population where the specialist leaf beetle Phaedon brassicae was prevalent, hairy plants were damaged less when the frequency of neighboring glabrous plants increased. Furthermore, temporal variation in the frequency of the two plant morphs showed that rarer morphs increased in frequency at the scale of 1-m-diameter patches between survey years. Using a mesocosm experiment, we demonstrated a rare-morph advantage for defense (leaf damage and herbivore abundance) and reproduction (flower and clone production) between hairy and glabrous plants in the presence of P. brassicae. However, this rare-morph advantage was not detected when beetles were absent, with glabrous plants having higher reproduction than hairy plants under these conditions regardless of frequency conditions. These findings highlight the overlooked but potentially critical role of herbivore-mediated apparent interaction in maintaining plant defense polymorphism.},

	abstract = {A plant-herbivore information “arms race”
            
              The consumption of plants by herbivores has driven the evolution of many diverse plant defense chemicals to which herbivores have constantly adapted. The transmission of chemical information at the community level is less known but important given the plethora of plant and herbivore species, especially in tropical communities. Zu
              et al.
              propose an information “arms race” approach to explain plant-herbivore chemical communication at the community level (see the Perspective by Solé). To test their conceptual framework, they used field data of herbivore-plant interactions and plant–volatile organic compound associations in a tropical dry forest. Their approach provides an understanding of the functioning and persistence of systems where individuals send and receive information in the form of signals to which other individuals react and, in turn, affect the behavior of other participants in these systems.

            An information theory framework for chemical signaling explains the evolutionary “arms race” between plants and insect herbivores.
          , 
            Plants emit an extraordinary diversity of chemicals that provide information about their identity and mediate their interactions with insects. However, most studies of this have focused on a few model species in controlled environments, limiting our capacity to understand plant-insect chemical communication in ecological communities. Here, by integrating information theory with ecological and evolutionary theories, we show that a stable information structure of plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can emerge from a conflicting information process between plants and herbivores. We corroborate this information “arms race” theory with field data recording plant-VOC associations and plant-herbivore interactions in a tropical dry forest. We reveal that plant VOC redundancy and herbivore specialization can be explained by a conflicting information transfer. Information-based communication approaches can increase our understanding of species interactions across trophic levels.},

We have investigated if females from polyphagous species have to pay for their ability to localize and evaluate plants from diﬀerent species with a lower ability to discriminate between conspeciﬁc host plants with diﬀerences in quality. Females of the monophagous butterﬂies Pol gonia sat rus, Vanessa indica and Inachis io and the polyphagous P. c-album and nthia cardui (all in Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae) were given a simultaneous choice of stinging nettles (Urtica dioica) of diﬀerent quality. In addition, the same choice trial was given to females from two populations of P. c-album with diﬀerent degrees of speciﬁcity. As predicted from the information processing hypothesis, all specialists discriminated signiﬁcantly against the bad quality nettle, whereas the generalists laid an equal amount of eggs on both types of nettle. There were no corresponding diﬀerences between specialist and generalist larvae in their ability to utilize poor quality leaves. Our study therefore suggests that female host-searching behaviour plays an important role in determining host plant range.},

Following attack, maize (Zea mays) responds to herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) and damageassociated molecular patterns (DAMPs), activating dynamic direct and indirect antiherbivore defense responses. To deﬁne underlying signaling processes, comparative analyses between plant elicitor peptide (Pep) DAMPs and fatty acid–amino acid conjugate (FAC) HAMPs were conducted. RNA sequencing analysis of early transcriptional changes following Pep and FAC treatments revealed quantitative differences in the strength of response yet a high degree of qualitative similarity, providing evidence for shared signaling pathways. In further comparisons of FAC and Pep responses across diverse maize inbred lines, we identiﬁed Mo17 as part of a small subset of lines displaying selective FAC insensitivity. Genetic mapping for FAC sensitivity using the intermated B73 3 Mo17 population identiﬁed a single locus on chromosome 4 associated with FAC sensitivity. Pursuit of multiple ﬁne-mapping approaches further narrowed the locus to 19 candidate genes. The top candidate gene identiﬁed, termed FAC SENSITIVITY ASSOCIATED (ZmFACS), encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) that belongs to the same family as a rice (Oryza sativa) receptor gene previously associated with the activation of induced responses to diverse Lepidoptera. Consistent with reduced sensitivity, ZmFACS expression was signiﬁcantly lower in Mo17 as compared to B73. Transient heterologous expression of ZmFACS in Nicotiana benthamiana resulted in a signiﬁcantly increased FAC-elicited response. Together, our results provide useful resources for studying early elicitorinduced antiherbivore responses in maize and approaches to discover gene candidates underlying HAMP sensitivity in grain crops.},

Induced plant responses to herbivores promote resistance and often involve the perception of specific herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs); however, precisely defined receptors and elicitors associated with herbivore recognition remain elusive.

Recent advances in uncovering signal transduction networks have revealed that defense trade-offs are often the result of regulatory “decisions” by the plant, enabling it to ﬁne-tune its phenotype in response to diverse environmental challenges. We place these results in the context of classic studies in ecology and evolutionary biology, and propose a unifying framework for growth–defense trade-offs as a means to study the plant’s allocation of limiting resources. Pervasive physiological costs constrain the upper limit to growth and defense traits, but the diversity of selective pressures on plants often favors negative correlations at intermediate trait levels. Despite the ubiquity of underlying costs of defense, the current challenge is using physiological and molecular approaches to predict the conditions where they manifest as detectable trade-offs.},

Indeed, many questions persist regarding the types of molecular changes and the classes of genes that underlie morphological variation within and among species. Here we have taken a candidate gene approach based on previous mapping results to identify the gene and ultimately a polymorphism that underlies a trichome density QTL in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our results show that natural allelic variation in the transcription factor ATMYC1 alters trichome density in A. thaliana; this is the first reported function for ATMYC1. Using sitedirected mutagenesis and yeast two-hybrid experiments, we demonstrate that a single amino acid replacement in ATMYC1, discovered in four ecotypes, eliminates known protein–protein interactions in the trichome initiation pathway. Additionally, in a broad screen for molecular variation at ATMYC1, including 72 A. thaliana ecotypes, a high-frequency block of variation was detected that results in .10\% amino acid replacement within one of the eight exons of the gene. This sequence variation harbors a strong signal of divergent selection but has no measurable effect on trichome density. Homologs of ATMYC1 are pleiotropic, however, so this block of variation may be the result of natural selection having acted on another trait, while maintaining the trichome density role of the gene. These results show that ATMYC1 is an important source of variation for epidermal traits in A. thaliana and indicate that the transcription factors that make up the TTG1 genetic pathway generally may be important sources of epidermal variation in plants.},

              INTRODUCTION
              
                Although much is known about plant traits that function in nonhost resistance against pathogens, little is known about nonhost resistance against herbivores, despite its agricultural importance, because of the lack of fieldwork.
                Empoasca
                leafhoppers, serious agricultural pests, identify host plants by eavesdropping on unknown outputs of jasmonate (JA)–mediated signaling in a native tobacco plant that is naturally variable in its JA signaling. The known sectors of this tobacco plant’s specialized defense metabolism are not effective against this insect, which calls for an unbiased approach.
              
            
            
              RATIONALE
              An unbiased forward-genetics approach based on the screening of a 26-parent recombinant inbred line population in a natural habitat with native herbivores was wedded with unbiased transcriptomic and mass spectrometry–based metabolomic analyses of reverse-genetics lines to identify defense chemistries produced by this native tobacco when probed by leafhoppers. Synthetic biology approaches were used to reconstitute these chemistries in crop plants.
            
            
              RESULTS
              
                The analysis revealed an
                Empoasca
                -elicited JA-JAZi module that pointed to the phenolamide master transcription factor,
                MYB8
                , as a central genetic hub clustering with putrescine-derived phenolamides. Using tobacco plants silenced for components of JA signaling (
                JAZ
                and
                MYC2
                genes) and phenolamide biosynthesis, the central role of a MYC2-MYB8-JAZi branch of JA signaling was confirmed; however, infiltration of
                MYC2
                -silenced plants with known putrescine-derived phenolamides did not alter
                Empoasca
                preference. Subsequent detailed structural analysis revealed an unknown metabolite whose abundance was regulated by the MYC2-MYB8-JAZi branch of JA signaling and was negatively correlated with
                Empoasca
                damage. Previous work on this unknown metabolite suggested a conjugate of caffeoylputrescine with a C-6 aldehyde produced during wound-induced lipid peroxidation—a process that leads to the formation of green leaf volatiles. Metabolite quantitative trait locus (mQTL) analysis and coexpression analysis pointed to two polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) and one berberine bridge enzyme-like 2 (BBL2) gene associated with the metabolite’s biosynthesis. The function of the proteins encoded by these genes was tested in both in vitro [
                Escherichia coli
                expression and enzymatic assays with (
                Z
                )-3-hexenal and caffeoylputrescine] and in vivo (transient expression in
                Solanum chilense
                and
                Vicia faba
                ) systems. The structure of the unknown metabolite was identified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to be a caffeoylputrescine–green leaf volatile compound (CPH), catalyzed by a PPO in a Michael addition reaction and requiring BBL2 in planta. Synthetic biology approaches confirmed the function of CPH in nonhost resistance against
                Empoasca
                leafhoppers in
                Nicotiana attenuata
                lines silenced to be defective in CPH production; in
                V. faba
                , a bean crop host plant of the leafhoppers unable to produce caffeoylputrescine; and in
                S. chilense
                .
              
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              The natural history–driven multi-omics framework used for the discovery of CPH and its marriage with synthetic biology approaches highlight how readily the results of millions of years of innovation by natural selection can be amortized and transferred to crop plants to catalyze a greener and ecologically more nuanced revolution in plant protection. Crop plants face challenges not substantially different from those faced by native plants; they are constantly tested by hidden herbivore communities that challenge the host-nonhost distinction. In a world of climate change and globally homogenized herbivore communities, opportunistic associations will dominate natural and man-made ecosystems. CPH represents a chemical innovation that allows a native plant to cope with these opportunistic associations and is readily engineered in crop plants.

	abstract = {Compared to those of their parents, are the traits of ﬁrstgeneration (F1) hybrids typically intermediate, biased toward one parent, or mismatched for alternative parental phenotypes? To address this empirical gap, we compiled data from 233 crosses in which traits were measured in a common environment for two parent taxa and their F1 hybrids. We ﬁnd that individual traits in F1s are halfway between the parental midpoint and one parental value. Considering pairs of traits together, a hybrid’s bivariate phenotype tends to resemble one parent (parent bias) about 50\% more than the other, while also exhibiting a similar magnitude of mismatch due to different traits having dominance in conﬂicting directions. Using data from an experimental ﬁeld planting of recombinant hybrid sunﬂowers, we illustrate that parent bias improves ﬁtness, whereas mismatch reduces ﬁtness. Our study has three major conclusions. First, hybrids are not phenotypically intermediate but rather exhibit substantial mismatch. Second, dominance is likely determined by the idiosyncratic evolutionary trajectories of individual traits and populations. Finally, selection against hybrids likely results from selection against both intermediate and mismatched phenotypes.},

              Allopolyploidy greatly expands the range of possible regulatory interactions among functionally redundant homoeologous genes. However, connection between the emerging regulatory complexity and expression and phenotypic diversity in polyploid crops remains elusive. Here, we use diverse wheat accessions to map expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and evaluate their effects on the population-scale variation in homoeolog expression dosage. The relative contribution of
              cis
              - and
              trans
              -eQTL to homoeolog expression variation is strongly affected by both selection and demographic events. Though
              trans

              cis
              -acting variants, which appear to be subjected to selection. The frequency and expression of homoeologous gene alleles showing strong expression dosage bias are predictive of variation in yield-related traits, and have likely been impacted by breeding for increased productivity. Our study highlights the importance of genomic variants affecting homoeolog expression dosage in shaping agronomic phenotypes and points at their potential utility for improving yield in polyploid crops.},

Ontogenetic trajectories can involve switches among defence traits, leading to complex shifting phenotypes across plant lifetimes. While considerable research has characterised ontogenetic trajectories for now hundreds of plant species, we still lack a clear understanding of the molecular, ecological and evolutionary factors driving these patterns. In this study, we identify several non-mutually exclusive factors that may have led to the evolution of ontogenetic trajectories in plant defence, including developmental constraints, resource allocation costs, multi-functionality of defence traits, and herbivore selection pressure. Evidence from recent physiological studies is highlighted to shed light on the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation and activation of these developmental changes. Overall, our goal is to promote new research avenues that would provide evidence for the factors that have promoted the evolution of this complex lifetime phenotype. Future research focusing on the questions and approaches identiﬁed here will advance the ﬁeld and shed light on why defence traits shift so dramatically across plant ontogeny, a widespread but poorly understood ecological pattern.},

Forward and reverse genetics approaches have revealed the prevalent role of pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins in editing in both plastids and mitochondria, conﬁrming the shared origin of this process in both organelles. The E domain at or near the C terminus of these proteins has been shown to be essential for editing, and is presumed to recruit the enzyme that deaminates the target cytidine residue. Here, we describe two mutants, otp71 and otp72, disrupted in genes encoding mitochondrial E–type PPR proteins with single editing defects in ccmFN2 and rpl16 transcripts, respectively. Comparisons between the E domains of these proteins and previously reported editing factors from chloroplasts suggested that there are characteristic differences in the proteins between the two organelles. To test this, we swapped E domains between two mitochondrial and two chloroplast editing factors. In all cases investigated, E domains from the same organelle (chloroplast or mitochondria) were found to be exchangeable; however, swapping the E domain between organelles led to non-functional editing factors. We conclude that the E domains of mitochondrial and plastid PPR proteins are not functionally equivalent, and therefore that an important component of the putative editing complexes in the two organelles may be different.},

Across 1,032 geographic regions worldwide, potential evapotranspiration, the number of wet days per year, and measurements of topographical and habitat heterogeneity emerge as core predictors of species richness. After accounting for environmental effects, the residual differences across the major floristic kingdoms are minor, with the exception of the uniquely diverse Cape Region, highlighting the important role of historical contingencies. Notably, the South African Cape region contains more than twice as many species as expected by the global environmental model, confirming its uniquely evolved flora. A combined multipredictor model explains ≈70\% of the global variation in species richness and fully accounts for the enigmatic latitudinal gradient in species richness. The models illustrate the geographic interplay of different environmental predictors of species richness. Our findings highlight that different hypotheses about the causes of diversity gradients are not mutually exclusive, but likely act synergistically with water–energy dynamics playing a dominant role. The presented geostatistical approach is likely to prove instrumental for identifying richness patterns of the many other taxa without single-species distribution data that still escape our understanding.},

In an attempt to create several types of sterile plant by genetic manipulation, we applied our Chimeric REpressor Gene-Silencing Technology (CRES-T) to four transcription factors, namely APETALA3, AGAMOUS, LEAFY and AtMYB26, involved in the regulation of petal and stamen identity, stamen and carpel identity, floral meristem identity and anther dehiscence, respectively, in Arabidopsis. Transgenic plants expressing each chimeric repressor exhibited, at high frequency, a sterile phenotype that resembled the loss-of-function phenotype of each corresponding gene. Furthermore, in the monocotyledonous crop plant ‘rice’, expression of the chimeric repressor derived from SUPERWOMAN1, the rice orthologue of APETALA3, resulted in the male sterile phenotype with high efficiency. Our results indicate that CRES-T provides a powerful tool for controlling the fertility of both monocots and dicots by exploiting transcription factors that are strongly conserved amongst plants.},

            In all eukaryotic cells, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) forms a tubular network whose generation requires the fusion of ER membranes. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the membrane-bound GTPase ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE3 (RHD3) is a potential candidate to mediate ER fusion. In addition, Arabidopsis has two tissue-specific isoforms of RHD3, namely RHD3-like (RL) proteins, and their function is not clear. Here, we show that a null allele of RHD3, rhd3-8, causes growth defects and shortened root hairs. A point mutant, rhd3-1, exhibits a more severe growth phenotype than the null mutant, likely because it exerts a dominant-negative effect on the RL proteins. Genetic analysis reveals that the double deletion of RHD3 and RL1 is lethal and that the rhd3 rl2 plants produce no viable pollen, suggesting that the RL proteins are redundant to RHD3. RHD3 family proteins can replace Sey1p, the homolog of RHD3 in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), in the maintenance of ER morphology, and they are able to fuse membranes both in vivo and in vitro. Our results suggest that RHD3 proteins mediate ER fusion and are essential for plant development and that the formation of the tubular ER network is of general physiological significance.},

            Jasmonates (JAs) mediate plant responses to insect attack, wounding, pathogen infection, stress, and UV damage and regulate plant fertility, anthocyanin accumulation, trichome formation, and many other plant developmental processes. Arabidopsis thaliana Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, substrates of the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1)–based SCFCOI1 complex, negatively regulate these plant responses. Little is known about the molecular mechanism for JA regulation of anthocyanin accumulation and trichome initiation. In this study, we revealed that JAZ proteins interact with bHLH (Transparent Testa8, Glabra3 [GL3], and Enhancer of Glabra3 [EGL3]) and R2R3 MYB transcription factors (MYB75 and Glabra1), essential components of WD-repeat/bHLH/MYB transcriptional complexes, to repress JA-regulated anthocyanin accumulation and trichome initiation. Genetic and physiological evidence showed that JA regulates WD-repeat/bHLH/MYB complex-mediated anthocyanin accumulation and trichome initiation in a COI1-dependent manner. Overexpression of the MYB transcription factor MYB75 and bHLH factors (GL3 and EGL3) restored anthocyanin accumulation and trichome initiation in the coi1 mutant, respectively. We speculate that the JA-induced degradation of JAZ proteins abolishes the interactions of JAZ proteins with bHLH and MYB factors, allowing the transcriptional function of WD-repeat/bHLH/MYB complexes, which subsequently activate respective downstream signal cascades to modulate anthocyanin accumulation and trichome initiation.},

In response to nitrogen depletion, the MYB genes PAP1/PAP2 (production of anthocyanin pigment 1/2) and GL3 are strongly induced, and anthocyanin synthesis is activated in seedlings and rosette stage plants. In this study we show that anthocyanins accumulate in both wild type and egl3, but not in gl3 loss-of-function mutants when depleted of nitrogen. Several structural genes of Xavonoid metabolism including CHS (chalcone synthase), FLS1 (Xavonol synthase 1) and ANS (anthocyanidin synthase) were induced in response to nitrogen depletion in wild type as well as in the egl3 and gl3 mutants. Strikingly, in the gl3 mutant DFR (dihydroXavonol-4-reductase) transcript level was only 2\% of the levels in wild type or egl3 mutant. Hence, low expression of DFR appears to be the bottleneck preventing anthocyanin synthesis in the gl3 mutant. The speciWc eVect on DFR, but not ANS is compatible with involvement of the MYBL2 inhibitor.},

            Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are integral for studying genotype-phenotype relationships and gaining a deeper understanding of the genetic architecture underlying trait variation. A plethora of genetic associations between distinct loci and various traits have been successfully discovered and published for the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. This success and the free availability of full genomes and phenotypic data for more than 1,000 different natural inbred lines led to the development of several data repositories. AraPheno (https://arapheno.1001genomes.org) serves as a central repository of population-scale phenotypes in A. thaliana, while the AraGWAS Catalog (https://aragwas.1001genomes.org) provides a publicly available, manually curated and standardized collection of marker-trait associations for all available phenotypes from AraPheno. In this major update, we introduce the next generation of both platforms, including new data, features and tools. We included novel results on associations between knockout-mutations and all AraPheno traits. Furthermore, AraPheno has been extended to display RNA-Seq data for hundreds of accessions, providing expression information for over 28 000 genes for these accessions. All data, including the imputed genotype matrix used for GWAS, are easily downloadable via the respective databases.},

Here, we review genes and proteins that are involved in plant–herbivore interactions and discuss how their discovery has structured the current standard model of plant–herbivore interactions. Plants perceive damage-associated and, possibly, herbivore-associated molecular patterns via receptors that activate early signaling components such as Ca2+, reactive oxygen species, and MAP kinases. Specific defense reprogramming proceeds via signaling networks that include phytohormones, secondary metabolites, and transcription factors. Local and systemic regulation of toxins, defense proteins, physical barriers, and tolerance traits protect plants against herbivores. Herbivores counteract plant defenses through biochemical defense deactivation, effector-mediated suppression of defense signaling, and chemically controlled behavioral changes. The molecular basis of plant–herbivore interactions is now well established for model systems. Expanding molecular approaches to unexplored dimensions of plant–insect interactions should be a future priority.},

Mechanistic models that explain the observed variety of herbivore responses to local plant community composition have, however, been lacking. We present a model of herbivore responses to patches that consist of two plant types, where herbivore densities on a focal plant are determined by a combination of patch-ﬁnding, within-patch redistribution, and patch-leaving. Our analyses show that the effect of plant neighborhood on herbivores depends both on how plant and herbivore traits combine to affect herbivore movement and on how experimental designs reveal the effects of plant density and plant relative frequency. Associational susceptibility should be the dominant pattern when herbivores have biased landing rates within patches. Other behavioral decision rules lead to mixed responses, but a common pattern is that in mixed patches, one plant type experiences associational resistance while the other plant experiences associational susceptibility. In some cases, the associational effect may shift sign along a gradient of plant frequency, suggesting that future empirical studies should include more than two plant frequencies to detect nonlinearities. Finally, we ﬁnd that associational susceptibility should be commonly observed in experiments using replacement designs, whereas associational resistance will be the dominant pattern when using additive designs. Consequently, outcomes from one experimental design cannot be directly compared to studies with other designs. Our model can also be translated to other systems with foragers searching for multiple resource types.},

	abstract = {Best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) is a method for obtaining point estimates of a random effect in a mixed effect model. Over the past decade it has been used extensively in ecology and evolutionary biology to predict individual breeding values and reaction norms. These predictions have been used to infer natural selection, evolutionary change, spatial-genetic patterns, individual reaction norms, and frailties. In this article we show analytically and through simulation and example why BLUP often gives anticonservative and biased estimates of evolutionary and ecological parameters. Although some concerns with BLUP methodology have been voiced before, the scale and breadth of the problems have probably not been widely appreciated. Bias arises because BLUPs are often used to estimate effects that are not explicitly accounted for in the model used to make the predictions. In these cases, predicted breeding values will often say more about phenotypic patterns than the genetic patterns of interest. An additional problem is that BLUPs are point estimates of quantities that are usually known with little certainty. Failure to account for this uncertainty in subsequent tests can lead to both bias and extreme anticonservatism. We demonstrate that restricted maximum likelihood and Bayesian solutions exist for these problems and show how unbiased and powerful tests can be derived that adequately quantify uncertainty. Of particular utility is a new test for detecting evolutionary change that not only accounts for prediction error in breeding values but also accounts for drift. To illustrate the problem, we apply these tests to long-term data on the Soay sheep (Ovis aries) and the great tit (Parus major) and show that previously reported temporal trends in breeding values are not supported.},

Yet we know little about whether genes of one species influence the persistence of interacting species in an ecological community. Here, we experimentally tested the effect of three plant defense genes on the persistence of an insect food web and found that a single allele at a single gene promoted coexistence by increasing plant growth rate, which in turn increased the intrinsic growth rates of species across multiple trophic levels. Our discovery of a “keystone gene” illustrates the need to bridge between biological scales, from genes to ecosystems, to understand community persistence.

            Genes to ecology
            
              In the past few decades, the identification of keystone species, that is, those with essential roles in structuring a community or ecosystem, has increased across systems. Barbour
              et al
              . extended this concept to genes, showing that a single allele of a particular plant defense gene facilitates species coexistence across a small experimental trophic system (see the Perspective by Nosil and Gompert). Specifically, plants with this allele grew faster, supporting larger populations of two species of herbivores and their predators. This finding suggests that genotype variation can play a role in the structure and function of organismal systems. —SNV

            Trichome development in Arabidopsis thaliana is a well-characterized model for the study of plant cell differentiation. Two genes that play an essential role in the initiation of trichome development are GL1 and TTG. Mutations in either gene prevent the initiation of most trichomes. The GL1 gene encodes a myb-related transcription factor. Mutations in TTG are pleiotropic, affecting anthocyanins, root hairs, and seed coat mucilage in addition to trichomes. Six ttg alleles were examined and shown to form a hypomorphic series. The severity of all aspects of the ttg phenotype varied in parallel in this allelic series. The weakest allele, ttg-10, causes frequent clusters of adjacent trichomes, suggesting a role for TTG in inhibiting neighboring cells from choosing the trichome fate. This allele results from a mutation in the 5′-untranslated region of ttg and creates an out-of-frame upstream AUG codon. The ttg-10 allele shows several unusual genetic interactions with the weak hypomorphic gl1-2 allele, including intergenic noncomplementation and a synthetic glabrous phenotype. These interactions are specific for the gl1-2 allele. The implication of these results for current models of trichome development is discussed.},

Our primary goal in this chapter is to provide a general guide to strategies for the effective use of the data and materials in these collections. To do this, we provide a general introduction to the T-DNA insertional sequenceindexed mutant collections with a focus on how best to use the available data sources for good line selection. As isolation of a homozygous line is a common next step once a potential disruption line has been identiﬁed, the second half of the chapter provides a step-by-step guide for the design and implementation of a T-DNA genotyping pipeline. Finally, we describe interpretation of genotyping results and include a troubleshooting section for common types of segregation distortions that we have observed. In this chapter we introduce both basic concepts and speciﬁc applications to both new and more experienced users of the collections for the design and implementation of small- to large-scale genotyping pipelines.},

	abstract = {The number of pollen grains varies within and between species. However, little is known about the molecular basis of this quantitative trait, in contrast with the many studies available on cell differentiation in the stamen. Recently, the ﬁrst gene responsible for pollen number variation, REDUCED POLLEN NUMBER1 (RDP1), was isolated by genome-wide association studies of Arabidopsis thaliana and exhibited the signature of natural selection. This gene encodes a homolog of yeast Mrt4 (mRNA turnover4), which is an assembly factor of the large ribosomal subunit. However, no further data were available to link ribosome function to pollen development. Here, we characterized the RDP1 gene using the standard A. thaliana accession Col-0. The frameshift mutant, rdp1-3 generated by CRISPR/Cas9 revealed the pleiotropic effect of RDP1 in ﬂowering, thus demonstrating that this gene is required for a broad range of processes other than pollen development. We found that the natural Col-0 allele conferred a reduced pollen number against the Bor-4 allele, as assessed using the quantitative complementation test, which is more sensitive than transgenic experiments. Together with a historical recombination event in Col-0, which was identiﬁed by sequence alignment, these results suggest that the coding sequence of RDP1 is the candidate region responsible for the natural phenotypic variation. To elucidate the biological processes in which RDP1 is involved, we conducted a transcriptome analysis. We found that genes responsible for ribosomal large subunit assembly/biogenesis were enriched among the differentially regulated genes, which supported the hypothesis that ribosome biogenesis is disturbed in the rdp1-3 mutant. Among the pollen-development genes, three key genes encoding basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (ABORTED MICROSPORES (AMS), bHLH010, and bHLH089), as well as direct downstream genes of AMS, were downregulated in the rdp1-3 mutant. In summary, our results suggest a specialized function of ribosomes in pollen development through RDP1, which harbors natural variants under selection.},

However, despite the importance of the CL/NC traits in horticulture and the fruit industry, the evolutionary significance of the distinction remains untested. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that NC fruits, which ripen only on the plant, are adapted to tree dispersers (feeding in the tree), and CL fruits, which ripen after falling from the plant, are adapted to ground dispersers. A literature review of 276 reports of 80 edible fruits found a strong correlation between CL/NC traits and the type of seed disperser: fruits dispersed by tree dispersers are more likely to be NC, and those dispersed by ground dispersers are more likely to be CL. NC fruits are more likely to have red–black skin and smaller seeds (preferred by birds), and CL fruits to have green–brownish skin and larger seeds (preferred by large mammals). These results suggest that the CL/NC traits have an important but overlooked seed dispersal function, and CL fruits may have an adaptive advantage in reducing ineffective frugivory by tree dispersers by falling before ripening.},

	abstract = {In Arabidopsis thaliana, mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) perturb various developmental processes. Whether these perturbations are caused by overall ribosome insufﬁciency or partial dysfunction of the ribosome caused by deﬁciency of a particular ribosomal protein is not known. To distinguish these possibilities, a comparative study using several r-protein mutants was required. Here, we identiﬁed mutations in 11 r-protein genes from previously isolated denticulata and pointed-leaves mutants. Most of these mutations were associated with pointed leaves, with reduced growth due to a decrease in the number or size of palisade mesophyll and pavement cells. In addition, leaf abaxialization was usually observed when these r-protein mutations were combined with asymmetric leaves1 (as1) and as2 mutations. These results suggest that the establishment of leaf polarity is highly sensitive to ribosome functionality in general. However, several r-protein mutants showed a preference towards a speciﬁc developmental defect. For example, rpl4d mutations did not affect cell proliferation but caused strong abaxialization of leaves in the as1 and as2 backgrounds. On the other hand, rps28b enhanced leaf abaxialization of as2 to a weaker extent than expected on the basis of its negative effect on cell proliferation. In addition, hypomorphic rps6a alleles had the strongest effects on most of the phenotypes examined. These ﬁndings suggest that deﬁciencies in these three r-protein genes lead to production of dysfunctional ribosomes. Depending on their structural abnormalities, dysfunctional ribosomes may affect translation of speciﬁc transcripts involved in the regulation of some leaf developmental processes.},

We studied flower visitors in a natural population of the species. Solitary bees, diptera and thrips are among the most frequently observed insects among the surprising diversity of insects visiting flowers of A. thaliana. Assuming that every visit equals an outcrossing event, the outcrossing rate was estimated to be 0.84 \%. This value falls between estimations of outcrossing rates from molecular data and those of artificial systems. Despite the rather low rate of flower visitation, A. thaliana can no longer be regarded as a completely self-pollinated plant species in the wild. This observation may explain recombination events observed in molecular analyses. Possible pollen transfer between populations due to the mobility of the observed insects should be considered in population genetic analyses.},

However, it is still unknown how defense variability translates into herbivore suppression. Nonlinear averaging and constraints in physiological tracking (also more generally called time-dependent effects) are the two mechanisms by which defense variability might impact herbivores [3, 4]. We conducted a set of experiments manipulating the mean and variability of a plant defense, showing that defense variability does suppress herbivore performance and that it does so through physiological tracking effects that cannot be explained by nonlinear averaging. While nonlinear averaging predicted higher or the same herbivore performance on a variable defense than on an invariable defense, we show that variability actually decreased herbivore performance and population growth rate. Defense variability reduces herbivore performance in a way that is more than the average of its parts. This is consistent with constraints in physiological matching of detoxiﬁcation systems for herbivores experiencing variable toxin levels in their diet and represents a more generalizable way of understanding the impacts of variability on herbivory [5]. Increasing defense variability in croplands at a scale encountered by individual herbivores can suppress herbivory, even if that is not anticipated by nonlinear averaging.},

            Growing threats from extreme climatic events and biodiversity loss have raised concerns about their interactive consequences for ecosystem functioning. Evidence suggests biodiversity can buffer ecosystem functioning during such climatic events. However, whether exposure to extreme climatic events will strengthen the biodiversity-dependent buffering effects for future generations remains elusive. We assess such transgenerational effects by exposing experimental grassland communities to eight recurrent summer droughts versus ambient conditions in the field. Seed offspring of 12 species are then subjected to a subsequent drought event in the glasshouse, grown individually, in monocultures or in 2-species mixtures. Comparing productivity between mixtures and monocultures, drought-selected plants show greater between-species complementarity than ambient-selected plants when recovering from the subsequent drought, causing stronger biodiversity effects on productivity and better recovery of drought-selected mixtures after the drought. These findings suggest exposure to recurrent climatic events can improve ecosystem responses to future events through transgenerational reinforcement of species complementarity.},

	abstract = {Although direct tree demographic responses to drought are widely recognized, studies of drought-mediated changes in tree interactions are rare. We hypothesize that drought exacerbates soil-water limitation and intensifies competition for water, but reduces light limitation and competition for light. We predict that competition would be stronger for trees (1) consuming more water or more susceptible to water deficits during drought and (2) intercepting more light or more susceptible to shade during postdrought periods. We tested these predictions in a 50-ha tropical forest plot by quantifying the effects of neighborhood mean trait values on tree survival during versus after a severe drought. We used wood density (WD) and leaf mass per area (LMA) as proxies for water and light use strategies, respectively. Tree survival was lower, canopy loss was greater, and sapling recruitment was greater during the drought relative to postdrought census intervals. This suggests that drought pushed water deficits to lethal extremes and increased understory light availability. Relationships between survival and neighborhood WD were independent of drought, which is inconsistent with our first prediction. In contrast, relationships between survival and neighborhood LMA differed strongly with drought. Survival time was unaffected by neighborhood LMA during drought, but was longer for trees of all sizes in low-LMA neighborhoods in the postdrought census interval, consistent with the prediction of reduced competition for light during drought. Our results suggest that severe drought might increase light availability and reduce competition for light in moist tropical forests.},

However, how new duplicate genes contribute to phenotypic evolution remains largely unknown, especially in plants. Here, we identiﬁed the new gene EXOV, derived from a partial gene duplication of its parental gene EXOVL in Arabidopsis thaliana. EXOV is a species-speciﬁc gene that originated within the last 3.5 million years and shows strong signals of positive selection. Unexpectedly, RNA-sequencing analyses revealed that, despite its young age, EXOV has acquired many novel direct and indirect interactions in which the parental gene does not engage. This observation is consistent with the high, selection-driven substitution rate of its encoded protein, in contrast to the slowly evolving EXOVL, suggesting an important role for EXOV in phenotypic evolution. We observed signiﬁcant differentiation of morphological changes for all phenotypes assessed in genome-edited and T-DNA insertional single mutants and in double T-DNA insertion mutants in EXOV and EXOVL. We discovered a substantial divergence of phenotypic effects by principal component analyses, suggesting neofunctionalization of the new gene. These results reveal a young gene that plays critical roles in biological processes that underlie morphological evolution in A. thaliana.},

The importance of indirect genetic effects has been recognized for a diversity of evolutionary processes including kin selection, sexual selection, community structure and multilevel selection, but data regarding their genetic architecture and prevalence throughout the genome remain scarce, especially for interactions between unrelated individuals. Using a set of 411 Bay-0 × Shahdara Arabidopsis recombinant inbred lines grown with Landsberg neighbours, we examined quantitative trait loci (QTL) having direct and indirect effects on size, developmental, and fitness related traits. Using an interval mapping approach, we identified 15 QTL with direct effects and found that 13 of these QTL had significant indirect effects on trait expression in neighbouring plants. These results suggest widespread pleiotropy, as nearly all direct effect QTL have associated pleiotropic indirect effects. Paradoxically, most indirect effects were of the same sign as direct effects, creating a pattern of nearly universal positive pleiotropy that makes most covariances between direct and indirect effects positive. These results are consistent with a complex genetic basis for intraspecific interactions, but suggest that interactions between neighbouring plants are largely positive, rather than negative as would be expected for competition. In addition to their evolutionary and ecological importance, these pleiotropic relationships between DGE and IGE loci have implications for quantitative genetic studies of natural populations as well as experimental design considerations. Additionally, studies that ignore IGEs may over- or underestimate quantitative genetic parameters, as well as the effect of and variance contributed by QTL.},

We show evidence for strong purifying selection on PAVs in genes, in particular for housekeeping genes and homeobox genes, and we ﬁnd that PAVs are concentrated in defense-related genes (R-genes, secondary metabolites) and F-box genes. This implies the presence of a “core” genome underlying basic cellular processes and a “ﬂexible” genome that includes genes that may be important in spatially or temporally varying selection. Further, we ﬁnd an excess of intermediate frequency PAVs in defense response genes in nearly all populations studied, consistent with a history of balancing selection on this class of genes. Finally, we ﬁnd that PAVs in genes involved in the cold requirement for ﬂowering (vernalization) and drought response are strongly associated with temperature at the sites of origin.},

But even species that are not threatened have seen reductions in their populations and geographic ranges, likely impacting their genetic diversity. Although preserving genetic diversity is key to maintaining adaptability of species, we lack predictive tools and global estimates of genetic diversity loss across ecosystems. By bridging theories of biodiversity and population genetics, we introduce a mathematical framework to understand the loss of naturally occurring DNA mutations within decreasing habitat within a species. Analysing genome-wide variation data of 10,095 geo-referenced individuals from 20 plant and animal species, we show that genome-wide diversity follows a power law with geographic area (the mutations-area relationship), which can predict genetic diversity loss in spatial computer simulations of local population extinctions.

            We know that the gain or loss of species can have cascading effects on food-web complexity; however, it is less clear whether the gain or loss of genetic variation within species, an often overlooked component of biodiversity, will similarly affect food-web structure. Here, we empirically identify how genetic variation within a host plant directly and indirectly affects its associated insect food web, resulting in distinct trophic interactions occurring on each host-plant genotype. Moreover, simulations of our empirical data suggest that higher levels of host-plant genetic variation lead to a more complex plant–insect food web. Our results suggest that preserving genetic variation within key species may be critical for maintaining complex and robust food webs under future environmental change.
          , 
            Theory predicts that intraspecific genetic variation can increase the complexity of an ecological network. To date, however, we are lacking empirical knowledge of the extent to which genetic variation determines the assembly of ecological networks, as well as how the gain or loss of genetic variation will affect network structure. To address this knowledge gap, we used a common garden experiment to quantify the extent to which heritable trait variation in a host plant determines the assembly of its associated insect food web (network of trophic interactions). We then used a resampling procedure to simulate the additive effects of genetic variation on overall food-web complexity. We found that trait variation among host-plant genotypes was associated with resistance to insect herbivores, which indirectly affected interactions between herbivores and their insect parasitoids. Direct and indirect genetic effects resulted in distinct compositions of trophic interactions associated with each host-plant genotype. Moreover, our simulations suggest that food-web complexity would increase by 20\% over the range of genetic variation in the experimental population of host plants. Taken together, our results indicate that intraspecific genetic variation can play a key role in structuring ecological networks, which may in turn affect network persistence.},

              Understanding how biological and environmental factors interactively shape the global distribution of plant and animal genetic diversity is fundamental to biodiversity conservation. Genetic diversity measured in local populations (GD
              P
              ) is correspondingly assumed representative for population fitness and eco-evolutionary dynamics. For 8356 populations across the globe, we report that plants systematically display much lower GD

              than animals, and that life history traits shape GD
              P
              patterns both directly (animal longevity and size), and indirectly by mediating core-periphery patterns (animal fecundity and plant dispersal). Particularly in some plant groups, peripheral populations can sustain similar GD
              P

Alternatively, the keystone individual concept from behavioral ecology posits that a single individual with an extreme phenotype can have disproportionate and irreplaceable effects on group dynamics. Here, I generalize this concept to include nonbehavioral traits and broader ecological and evolutionary dynamics. I test for the effects of individuals with extreme phenotypes on the ecology and evolution of a gall-forming ﬂy and its natural enemies that select for opposite gall sizes. Speciﬁcally, I introduce a putatively keystone predator-attracting individual gall-maker, hypothesizing that the presence of such an individual should (1) increase gall maker population-level mortality, (2) cause consumer communities to be dominated by species that are most attracted to the keystone individual, (3) increase selection for traits conferring defense against the most common consumer, and (4) weaken patterns of stabilizing selection. I ﬁnd support for both the ecological and evolutionary consequences of single individuals with extreme phenotypes, suggesting that they can be considered keystone individuals. I discuss the generality of the keystone individual concept, suggesting likely consequences for ecology and evolution.},

	abstract = {Environmental clines in organismal defensive traits are usually attributed to stronger selection by enemies at lower latitudes or near the host’s range center. Nonetheless, little functional evidence has supported this hypothesis, especially for coevolving plants and herbivores. We quantified cardenolide toxins in seeds of 24 populations of common milkweed (
              Asclepias syriaca
              ) across 13 degrees of latitude, revealing a pattern of increasing cardenolide concentrations toward the host's range center. The unusual nitrogen-containing cardenolide labriformin was an exception and peaked at higher latitudes. Milkweed seeds are eaten by specialist lygaeid bugs that are even more tolerant of cardenolides than the monarch butterfly, concentrating most cardenolides (but not labriformin) from seeds into their bodies. Accordingly, whether cardenolides defend seeds against these specialist bugs is unclear. We demonstrate that
              Oncopeltus fasciatus
              (Lygaeidae) metabolized two major compounds (glycosylated aspecioside and labriformin) into distinct products that were sequestered without impairing growth. We next tested several isolated cardenolides in vitro on the physiological target of cardenolides (Na
              +
              /K
              +
              -ATPase); there was little variation among compounds in inhibition of an unadapted Na

              /K

              -ATPase, but tremendous variation in impacts on that of monarchs and
              Oncopeltu

              Oncopeltus
              had the greater advantage over monarchs in tolerating labriformin compared to other compounds. Three metabolized (and stored) cardenolides were less toxic than their parent compounds found in seeds. Our results suggest that a potent plant defense is evolving by natural selection along a geographical cline and targets specialist herbivores, but is met by insect tolerance, detoxification, and sequestration.},

            A census of the biomass on Earth is key for understanding the structure and dynamics of the biosphere. However, a global, quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the ≈550 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants (≈450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals (≈2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria (≈70 Gt C) and archaea (≈7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that terrestrial biomass is about two orders of magnitude higher than marine biomass and estimate a total of ≈6 Gt C of marine biota, doubling the previous estimated quantity. Our analysis reveals that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants.},

	abstract = {Background: Sexual dimorphism occurs widely across the animal kingdom and has profound effects on evolutionary trajectories. Here, we investigate sex-specific gene expression in Ischnura elegans (Odonata: dragonflies and damselflies), a species with pronounced sexual differences including a female-limited colour polymorphism with two female-like gynochrome morphs and one male-mimicking, androchrome morph. Whole-organism transcriptome profiling and sex-biased gene expression analysis was conducted on adults of both sexes (pooling all females as well as separating the three morphs) to gain insights into genes and pathways potentially associated with sexual development and sexual conflict.
Results: The de novo transcriptome assembly was of high quality and completeness (54 k transcripts; 99.6\% CEGMA score; 55\% annotated). We identified transcripts of several relevant pathways, including transcripts involved in sex determination, hormone biosynthesis, pigmentation and innate immune signalling. A total of 1,683 genes were differentially expressed (DE) between males and all females (1,173 were female-biased; 510 male-biased). The DE genes were associated with sex-specific physiological and reproductive processes, olfaction, pigmentation (ommochrome and melanin), hormone (ecdysone) biosynthesis and innate immunity signalling pathways. Comparisons between males and each female morph category showed that the gynochromes differed more from males than the androchrome morph.
Conclusions: This is the first study to characterize sex-biased gene expression in odonates, one of the most ancient extant insect orders. Comparison between I. elegans sexes revealed expression differences in several genes related to sexual differences in behaviour and development as well as morphology. The differential expression of several olfactory genes suggests interesting sexual components in the detection of odours, pheromones and environmental volatiles. Up-regulation of pigmentation pathways in females indicates a prominent role of ommochrome pigments in the formation of the genetically controlled female colour polymorphism. Finally, the female-biased expression of several immunity genes suggests a stronger immune response in females, possibly related to the high levels of male mating harassment and recurrent matings in this species, both of which have been shown to injure females and expose them to sexually transmitted diseases and toxins contained in seminal fluids.},

              Key message
              A powerful QTL analysis method for nested association mapping populations is presented. Based on a one-stage multi-locus model, it provides accurate predictions of founder specific QTL effects.
            
            
              Abstract
              
                Nested association mapping (NAM) populations have been created to enable the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in different genetic backgrounds. A whole-genome nested association mapping (WGNAM) method is presented to perform QTL analysis in NAM populations. The WGNAM method is an adaptation of the multi-parent whole genome average interval mapping approach where the crossing design is incorporated through the probability of inheriting founder alleles for every marker across the genome. Based on a linear mixed model, this method provides a one-stage analysis of raw phenotypic data, molecular markers, and crossing design. It simultaneously scans the whole-genome through an iterative process leading to a model with all the identified QTL while keeping the false positive rate low. The WGNAM approach was assessed through a simulation study, confirming to be a powerful and accurate method for QTL analysis for a NAM population. This novel method can also accommodate a multi-reference NAM (MR-NAM) population where donor parents are crossed with multiple reference parents to increase genetic diversity. Therefore, a demonstration is presented using a MR-NAM population for wheat (
                Triticum aestivum
                L.) to perform a QTL analysis for plant height. The strength and size of the putative QTL were summarized enhancing the understanding of the QTL effects depending on the parental origin. Compared to other methods, the proposed methodology based on a one-stage analysis provides greater power to detect QTL and increased accuracy in the estimation of their effects. The WGNAM method establishes the basis for accurate QTL mapping studies for NAM and MR-NAM populations.},

In times of global climate change, tree populations need to adapt to rapidly changing environmental conditions. The predicted warmer and drier conditions will potentially result in locally maladapted populations. There is evidence that major genera of the Fagaceae are already negatively affected by climate change-related factors such as drought and associated biotic stressors. Therefore, knowledge of the mechanisms underlying adaptation is of great interest. In this review, we summarise current literature related to genetic adaptation to abiotic environmental conditions. We begin with an overview of genetic diversity in Fagaceae species and then summarise current knowledge related to drought stress tolerance, bud burst timing and frost tolerance in the Fagaceae. Finally, we discuss the role of hybridisation, epigenetics and phenotypic plasticity in adaptation.},

We investigated how specialist and generalist natural enemies differ as biological control agents of pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum), and how interactions among natural enemies affect successful control. In alfalfa, pea aphids are attacked by a specialist parasitoid wasp, Aphidius ervi, and a guild of generalist predators primarily made up of Nabis and Orius bugs, coccinellid and carabid beetles, and web-building spiders. In three ﬁeld experiments, we manipulated the parasitoid, then the generalist predator guild, and ﬁnally both classes of natural enemy, and recorded resulting impacts on pea aphid population control. The parasitoid caused little immediate reduction in aphid population growth but caused a large decline after a delay corresponding to the generation time of the parasitoid. In contrast, the generalist guild caused an immediate decline in the aphid population growth rate. However, the generalists did not exert density-dependent control, so aphid densities continued to increase throughout the experiment. The third ﬁeld experiment in which we simultaneously manipulated parasitoids and predators investigated the possibility of ‘‘nonadditive effects’’ on aphid control. Densities of parasitoid pupae were 50\% lower in the presence of generalist predators, indicating intraguild predation. Nonetheless, the ratio of parasitoids to aphids was not changed, and the impact of the two types of natural enemies was additive.},

A comprehensive annotation of its genome paves the way for understanding the functions and activities of all types of transcripts, including mRNA, the various classes of non-coding RNA, and small RNA. The TAIR10 annotation update had a profound impact on Arabidopsis research but was released more than 5 years ago. Maintaining the accuracy of the annotation continues to be a prerequisite for future progress. Using an integrative annotation pipeline, we assembled tissue-speciﬁc RNA-Seq libraries from 113 datasets and constructed 48 359 transcript models of protein-coding genes in eleven tissues. In addition, we annotated various classes of non-coding RNA including microRNA, long intergenic RNA, small nucleolar RNA, natural antisense transcript, small nuclear RNA, and small RNA using published datasets and in-house analytic results. Altogether, we identiﬁed 635 novel protein-coding genes, 508 novel transcribed regions, 5178 non-coding RNAs, and 35 846 small RNA loci that were formerly unannotated. Analysis of the splicing events and RNA-Seq based expression proﬁles revealed the landscapes of gene structures, untranslated regions, and splicing activities to be more intricate than previously appreciated. Furthermore, we present 692 uniformly expressed housekeeping genes, 43\% of whose human orthologs are also housekeeping genes. This updated Arabidopsis genome annotation with a substantially increased resolution of gene models will not only further our understanding of the biological processes of this plant model but also of other species.},

              report the first results from a large biodiversity experiment in a subtropical forest in China. The study combines many replicates, realistic tree densities, and large plot sizes with a wide range of species richness levels. After 8 years of the experiment, the findings suggest strong positive effects of tree diversity on forest productivity and carbon accumulation. Thus, changing from monocultures to more mixed forests could benefit both restoration of biodiversity and mitigation of climate change.

            In a replicated experiment in a subtropical forest, higher tree species diversity promoted productivity and carbon storage.
          , 
            Biodiversity experiments have shown that species loss reduces ecosystem functioning in grassland. To test whether this result can be extrapolated to forests, the main contributors to terrestrial primary productivity, requires large-scale experiments. We manipulated tree species richness by planting more than 150,000 trees in plots with 1 to 16 species. Simulating multiple extinction scenarios, we found that richness strongly increased stand-level productivity. After 8 years, 16-species mixtures had accumulated over twice the amount of carbon found in average monocultures and similar amounts as those of two commercial monocultures. Species richness effects were strongly associated with functional and phylogenetic diversity. A shrub addition treatment reduced tree productivity, but this reduction was smaller at high shrub species richness. Our results encourage multispecies afforestation strategies to restore biodiversity and mitigate climate change.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic habitat loss and climate change are reducing species’ geographic ranges, increasing extinction risk and losses of species’ genetic diversity. Although preserving genetic diversity is key to maintaining species’ adaptability, we lack predictive tools and global estimates of genetic diversity loss across ecosystems. We introduce a mathematical framework that bridges biodiversity theory and population genetics to understand the loss of naturally occurring DNA mutations with decreasing habitat. By analyzing genomic variation of 10,095 georeferenced individuals from 20 plant and animal species, we show that genome-wide diversity follows a mutations-area relationship power law with geographic area, which can predict genetic diversity loss from local population extinctions. We estimate that more than 10\% of genetic diversity may already be lost for many threatened and nonthreatened species, surpassing the United Nations’ post-2020 targets for genetic preservation.

            Declining genetic diversity
            
              Habitat loss is one of the major drivers of species extinctions and declines of species richness at local scales. Smaller areas of remnant habitat also harbor smaller populations and lower genetic diversity, which may limit potential adaptation to environmental change. Exposito-Alonso
              et al
              . developed a framework to predict decreases in naturally occurring mutations, and thus genetic diversity, with habitat loss (see the Perspective by Ruegg and Turbek). Georeferenced genomic data from across the native ranges of the small mustard plant
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              and 20 other species suggest that the mutation-area relationship follows a power law. This relationship predicts that many species have already experienced substantial genetic diversity loss. —BEL

	abstract = {Non-genetic influences on phenotypic traits can affect our interpretation of genetic variance and the evolutionary potential of populations to respond to selection, with consequences for our ability to predict the outcomes of selection. Long-term population surveys and experiments have shown that quantitative genetic estimates are influenced by nongenetic effects, including shared environmental effects, epigenetic effects, and social interactions. Recent developments to the “animal model” of quantitative genetics can now allow us to calculate precise individual-based measures of non-genetic phenotypic variance. These models can be applied to a much broader range of contexts and data types than used previously, with the potential to greatly expand our understanding of nongenetic effects on evolutionary potential. Here, we provide the first practical guide for researchers interested in distinguishing between genetic and nongenetic causes of phenotypic variation in the animal model. The methods use matrices describing individual similarity in nongenetic effects, analogous to the additive genetic relatedness matrix. In a simulation of various phenotypic traits, accounting for environmental, epigenetic, or cultural resemblance between individuals reduced estimates of additive genetic variance, changing the interpretation of evolutionary potential. These variances were estimable for both direct and parental nongenetic variances. Our tutorial outlines an easy way to account for these effects in both wild and experimental populations. These models have the potential to add to our understanding of the effects of genetic and nongenetic effects on evolutionary potential. This should be of interest both to those studying heritability, and those who wish to understand nongenetic variance.},

	abstract = {Plant–insect interactions are common and important in basic and applied biology. Trait and genetic variation can affect the outcome and evolution of these interactions, but the relative contributions of plant and insect genetic variation and how these interact remain unclear and are rarely subject to assessment in the same experimental context. Here, we address this knowledge gap using a recent host-range expansion onto alfalfa by the Melissa blue butterfly. Common garden rearing experiments and genomic data show that caterpillar performance depends on plant and insect genetic variation, with insect genetics contributing to performance earlier in development and plant genetics later. Our models of performance based on caterpillar genetics retained predictive power when applied to a second common garden. Much of the plant genetic effect could be explained by heritable variation in plant phytochemicals, especially saponins, peptides, and phosphatidyl cholines, providing a possible mechanistic understanding of variation in the species interaction. We find evidence of polygenic, mostly additive effects within and between species, with consistent effects of plant genotype on growth and development across multiple butterfly species. Our results inform theories of plant–insect coevolution and the evolution of diet breadth in herbivorous insects and other host-specific parasites.},

In practice these corrections turn out to be complicated, since there can be different types of spatial effects; those due to management interventions applied to the field plots and those due to various kinds of erratic spatial trends. This paper explores the use of two-dimensional smooth surfaces to model random spatial variation. We propose the use of anisotropic tensor product P-splines to explicitly model large-scale (global trend) and small-scale (local trend) spatial dependence. On top of this spatial field, effects of genotypes, blocks, replicates, and/or other sources of spatial variation are described by a mixed model in a standard way. Each component in the model is shown to have an effective dimension. They are closely related to variance estimation, and helpful for characterising the importance of model components. An important result of this paper is the formal proof of the relation between several definitions of heritability and the effective dimension associated with the genetic component. The practical value of our approach is illustrated by simulations and analyses of large-scale plant breeding experiments. An R-package, SpATS, is provided.},

              Preservation of genetic diversity is critical to the resilience of species in the face of global change. To meet international calls to preserve at least 90\% of species’ genetic diversity, researchers and conservationists need a way to reliably predict genetic diversity loss resulting from human activities (

          , 
            
              Global biodiversity policy is at a crossroads. Recent global assessments of living nature (

              4
              ). Against this backdrop, nations are now negotiating the next generation of the CBD's global goals [see supplementary materials (SM)], due for adoption in 2021, which will frame actions of governments and other actors for decades to come. In response to the goals proposed in the draft post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) made public by the CBD (
              5
              ), we urge negotiators to consider three points that are critical if the agreed goals are to stabilize or reverse nature's decline. First, multiple goals are required because of nature's complexity, with different facets—genes, populations, species, deep evolutionary history, ecosystems, and their contributions to people—having markedly different geographic distributions and responses to human drivers. Second, interlinkages among these facets mean that goals must be defined and developed holistically rather than in isolation, with potential to advance multiple goals simultaneously and minimize trade-offs between them. Third, only the highest level of ambition in setting each goal, and implementing all goals in an integrated manner, will give a realistic chance of stopping—and beginning to reverse—biodiversity loss by 2050.},

	abstract = {Historic yield advances in the major crops have, to a large extent, been achieved by selection for improved productivity of groups of plant individuals such as high-density stands. Research suggests that such improved group productivity depends on “cooperative” traits (e.g., erect leaves, short stems) that—while beneficial to the group—decrease individual fitness under competition. This poses a problem for some traditional breeding approaches, especially when selection occurs at the level of individuals, because “selfish” traits will be selected for and reduce yield in high-density monocultures. One approach, therefore, has been to select individuals based on ideotypes with traits expected to promote group productivity. However, this approach is limited to architectural and physiological traits whose effects on growth and competition are relatively easy to anticipate. Here, we developed a general and simple method for the discovery of alleles promoting cooperation in plant stands. Our method is based on the game-theoretical premise that alleles increasing cooperation benefit the monoculture group but are disadvantageous to the individual when facing noncooperative neighbors. Testing the approach using the model plant
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              , we found a major effect locus where the rarer allele was associated with increased cooperation and productivity in high-density stands. The allele likely affects a pleiotropic gene, since we find that it is also associated with reduced root competition but higher resistance against disease. Thus, even though cooperation is considered evolutionarily unstable except under special circumstances, conflicting selective forces acting on a pleiotropic gene might maintain latent genetic variation for cooperation in nature. Such variation, once identified in a crop, could rapidly be leveraged in modern breeding programs and provide efficient routes to increase yields.},

	abstract = {Levels of gene expression underpin organismal phenotypes1,2, but the nature of selection that acts on gene expression and its role in adaptive evolution remain unknown1,2. Here we assayed gene expression in rice (Oryza sativa)3, and used phenotypic selection analysis to estimate the type and strength of selection on the levels of more than 15,000 transcripts4,5. Variation in most transcripts appears (nearly) neutral or under very weak stabilizing selection in wet paddy conditions (with median standardized selection differentials near zero), but selection is stronger under drought conditions. Overall, more transcripts are conditionally neutral (2.83\%) than are antagonistically pleiotropic6 (0.04\%), and transcripts that display lower levels of expression and stochastic noise7–9 and higher levels of plasticity9 are under stronger selection. Selection strength was further weakly negatively associated with levels of cis-regulation and network connectivity9. Our multivariate analysis suggests that selection acts on the expression of photosynthesis genes4,5, but that the efficacy of selection is genetically constrained under drought conditions10. Drought selected for earlier flowering11,12 and a higher expression of OsMADS18 (Os07g0605200), which encodes a MADS-box transcription factor and is a known regulator of early flowering13—marking this gene as a drought-escape gene11,12. The ability to estimate selection strengths provides insights into how selection can shape molecular traits at the core of gene action.},

              On macroevolutionary timescales, extensive mutations and phylogenetic uncertainty mask the signals of genotype–phenotype associations underlying convergent evolution. To overcome this problem, we extended the widely used framework of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rate ratios and developed the novel metric

                C

              distinguishes natural selection from genetic noise and phylogenetic errors in simulation and real examples, its accuracy allows an exploratory genome-wide search of adaptive molecular convergence without phenotypic hypothesis or candidate genes. Using gene expression data, we explored over 20 million branch combinations in vertebrate genes and identified the joint convergence of expression patterns and protein sequences with amino acid substitutions in functionally important sites, providing hypotheses on undiscovered phenotypes. We further extended our method with a heuristic algorithm to detect highly repetitive convergence among computationally non-trivial higher-order phylogenetic combinations. Our approach allows bidirectional searches for genotype–phenotype associations, even in lineages that diverged for hundreds of millions of years.},

Hundreds of studies spanning terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems show that high-diversity mixtures are approximately twice as productive as monocultures of the same species and that this difference increases through time. These impacts of higher diversity have multiple causes, including interspeciﬁc complementarity, greater use of limiting resources, decreased herbivory and disease, and nutrient-cycling feedbacks that increase nutrient stores and supply rates over the long term. These experimentally observed effects of diversity are consistent with predictions based on a variety of theories that share a common feature: All have trade-off-based mechanisms that allow long-term coexistence of many different competing species. Diversity loss has an effect as great as, or greater than, the effects of herbivory, ﬁre, drought, nitrogen addition, elevated CO2, and other drivers of environmental change.

	abstract = {Plants are at the trophic base of terrestrial ecosystems, and the diversity of plant species in an ecosystem is a principle determinant of community structure. This may arise from diverse functional traits among species. In fact, genetic diversity within species can have similarly large effects. However, studies of intraspecific genetic diversity have used genotypes varying in several complex traits, obscuring the specific phenotypic variation responsible for community-level effects. Using lines of the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata genetically altered in specific well-characterized defense traits and planted into experimental populations in their native habitat, we investigated community-level effects of trait diversity in populations of otherwise isogenic plants. We conclude that the frequency of defense traits in a population can determine the outcomes of these traits for individuals. Furthermore, our results suggest that some ecosystem-level services afforded by genetically diverse plant populations could be recaptured in intensive monocultures engineered to be functionally diverse.
          , 
            Plants are at the base of many food webs. This means that the different traits and characteristics of the plant species in an ecosystem can have a large impact on the animals and other organisms that live there.
            Individuals within the same plant species often differ in multiple genes. This ‘genetic diversity’ can affect the populations of other organisms in their ecosystem, for example, by altering which species are present, and the number of individuals. However, previous studies that investigated plant genetic diversity in ecosystems used plants that varied in multiple, usually unknown, genetic traits, which made it difficult to identify specific genetic traits in plants that can influence the whole ecosystem.
            One way that plants affect their ecosystems involves how they defend themselves against the herbivores that try to eat them. For example, plants can use sharp spines or harmful chemicals to deter herbivores, or attract predators that will attack the herbivores.
            Here, Schuman et al. carried out a 2-year field study using wild tobacco plants that had been genetically altered to employ different defensive strategies. This was achieved by altering the expression of three genes in the plants in specific combinations. Two of the genes, called LOX2 and LOX3, are required to make most of the chemicals that tobacco plants use to defend themselves against herbivores. The third gene, called TPS10, which comes from the crop plant maize, gives plants the ability to release a fragrance that attracts natural predators of their herbivores.
            Except for these specific alterations, the plants were otherwise genetically identical. These plants were then grown either alone, or in groups of five plants, which reflects the normal size of groups of wild tobacco growing in its natural environment. The groups contained mixtures of plants with different gene alterations.
            Schuman et al. found that the expression levels of these genes in individual plants could determine how well the whole group fared in several different measures of plant health and defense. For example, plants lacking LOX2 and LOX3 usually appeared to be less healthy and they were less likely to survive long enough to reproduce because they were less able to defend themselves against herbivores. However, if these plants were grown in a group with one plant that expressed TPS10, all of the plants in the group looked healthier and were more likely to survive long enough to reproduce.
            Many crops are grown in large fields containing individual plants that are largely genetically identical, which makes them more vulnerable to disease. Schuman et al.'s findings suggest that some of the community-level protective effects provided by diversity in wild populations of plants could be introduced into crop fields by altering the expression of a few specific genes in some individuals.},

              Higher plants produce specialized metabolites to cope with biotic and abiotic challenges faced in natural environments. The diversity and complexity of specialized metabolism is often beneficial, providing functional synergisms and evolutionary stability when metabolic solutions to ecological problems are deployed as mixtures. These benefits of diversity have recently been realized in the deployment of antibiotics, insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides. However, the functional downside of metabolite diversity is rarely studied, in part because the mechanisms of post-ingestive metabolite interactions are largely unknown. Here we showed that larvae of the tobacco hornworm,
              Manduca sexta
              , rearrange key constituents of two distinct defense pathways in its wild tobacco host plant,
              Nicotiana attenuata
              , to thwart the defensive properties of both pathways.
            
          , 
            
              Deploying toxins in complex mixtures is thought to be advantageous and is observed during antagonistic interactions in nature. Toxin mixtures are widely utilized in medicine and pest control, as they are thought to slow the evolution of detoxification counterresponses in the targeted organisms. Here we show that caterpillars rearrange key constituents of two distinct plant defense pathways to postingestively disable the defensive properties of both pathways. Specifically, phenolic esters of quinic acid, chlorogenic acids (CAs), potent herbivore and ultraviolet (UV) defenses, are reesterified to decorate particular sugars of 17-hydroxygeranyllinalool diterpene glycosides (HGL-DTGs) and prevent their respective anti–herbivore defense functions. This was discovered through the employment of comparative metabolomics of the leaves of
              Nicotiana attenuata
              and the frass of this native tobacco’s specialist herbivore,
              Manduca sexta
              larvae. Feeding caterpillars on leaves of transgenic plants abrogated in each of the two pathways, separately and together, revealed that one of the fully characterized frass conjugates, caffeoylated HGL-DTG, originated from ingested CA and HGL-DTGs and that both had negative effects on the defensive function of the other compound class, as revealed by rates of larval mass gain. This negative defensive synergy was further explored in 183
              N. attenuata
              natural accessions, which revealed a strong negative covariance between the two defense pathways. Further mapping analyses in a biparental recombinant inbred line (RIL) population imputed quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for the two pathways at distinct genomic locations. The postingestive repurposing of defense metabolism constituents reveals a downside of deploying toxins in mixtures, a downside which plants in nature have evolved to counter.},

              Synchronisation of flowering phenology has often been observed between individuals within plant species. We expected that a critical role of flowering-time control under natural conditions is a phenological synchronisation. However, no studies have quantified the level of synchronisation of reproductive timing relative to germination timing under natural conditions. In a sequential seeding experiment (SSE) in which we manipulated the germination timing of
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              accessions, we developed a quantification index to evaluate reproductive synchrony in annual plants. In the SSE, we identified a novel phenomenon of reproductive synchrony: senescence synchrony. The role of vernalisation in realising flowering synchrony between plants of different ages under natural conditions was demonstrated by synchronisation and de-synchronisation of flowering initiation in vernalisation-sensitive and less-vernalisation-sensitive accessions, respectively. We also observed up-regulation of senescence-related genes at corresponding times. The approach we developed in this study provides a set of concepts and procedures that can be used to study reproductive synchrony experimentally under natural conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) are six-carbon volatile oxylipins ubiquitous in vascular plants. GLVs are produced from acyl groups in the biological membranes via oxygenation by a pathway-specific lipoxygenase (LOX) and a subsequent cleavage reaction by hydroperoxide lyase. Because of the universal distribution and ability to form GLVs, they have been anticipated to play a common role in vascular plants. While resting levels in intact plant tissues are low, GLVs are immediately synthesized de novo in response to stresses, such as insect herbivory, that disrupt the cell structure. This rapid GLV burst is one of the fastest responses of plants to cell-damaging stresses; therefore, GLVs are the first plant-derived compounds encountered by organisms that interact with plants irrespective of whether the interaction is competitive or friendly. GLVs should therefore be considered important mediators between plants and organisms that interact with them. GLVs can have direct effects by deterring herbivores and pathogens as well as indirect effects by attracting predators of herbivores, while other plants can recruit them to prepare their defenses in a process called priming. While the beneficial effects provided to plants by GLVs are often less dramatic and even complementary, the buildup of these tiny effects due to the multiple functions of GLVs can amass to levels that become substantially beneficial to plants. This review summarizes the current understanding of the spatiotemporal resolution of GLV biosynthesis and GLV functions and outlines how GLVs support the basic health of plants.},

	abstract = {Background:  Plant breeders seek to develop cultivars with maximal agronomic value, which is often assessed using numerous, often genetically correlated traits. As intervention on one trait will affect the value of another, breeding decisions should consider the relationships among traits in the context of putative causal structures (i.e., trait networks). While multi-trait genome-wide association studies (MTM-GWAS) can infer putative genetic signals at the multivariate scale, standard MTM-GWAS does not accommodate the network structure of phenotypes, and therefore does not address how the traits are interrelated. We extended the scope of MTM-GWAS by incorporating trait network structures into GWAS using structural equation models (SEM-GWAS). Here, we illustrate the utility of SEM-GWAS using a digital metric for shoot biomass, root biomass, water use, and water use efficiency in rice.
Results:  A salient feature of SEM-GWAS is that it can partition the total single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects acting on a trait into direct and indirect effects. Using this novel approach, we show that for most QTL associated with water use, total SNP effects were driven by genetic effects acting directly on water use rather that genetic effects originating from upstream traits. Conversely, total SNP effects for water use efficiency were largely due to indirect effects originating from the upstream trait, projected shoot area.
Conclusions:  We describe a robust framework that can be applied to multivariate phenotypes to understand the interrelationships between complex traits. This framework provides novel insights into how QTL act within a phenotypic network that would otherwise not be possible with conventional multi-trait GWAS approaches. Collectively, these results suggest that the use of SEM may enhance our understanding of complex relationships among agronomic traits.},

              The number of male gametes is critical for reproductive success and varies between and within species. The evolutionary reduction of the number of pollen grains encompassing the male gametes is widespread in selfing plants. Here, we employ genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify underlying loci and to assess the molecular signatures of selection on pollen number-associated loci in the predominantly selfing plant
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              . Regions of strong association with pollen number are enriched for signatures of selection, indicating polygenic selection. We isolate the gene

In contrast to pleiotropic null mutants, only pollen numbers are significantly affected by natural allelic variants. These data support theoretical predictions that reduced investment in male gametes is advantageous in predominantly selfing species.},

Among predators in the generalist predator complex present in agricultural ﬁelds, wolf spiders (Araneae: Lycosidae) are found on the ground and cobweb spiders (Araneae: Theridiidae) build webs in the foliage. We present groupspeciﬁc primers developed for ﬁve ﬂea beetle species within the genus Phyllotreta and study the incidence of predation of ﬂea beetles by these spider groups using DNA-based gut-content analysis. Wolf spiders of the genus Pardosa Koch and the cobweb spider, Phylloneta impressa (Koch), were collected in three winter OSR ﬁelds. Flea beetle densities as well as the occurrence of predators and alternative prey were monitored. In total 19.4\% of the collected Pardosa tested positive for ﬂea beetle DNA in the polymerase chain reaction analyses, whereas 10\% P. impressa were positive. Pardosa were more likely to be positive for ﬂea beetle DNA when Pardosa activity density was low. Phylloneta impressa were more likely to be positive for ﬂea beetle DNA if they were positive for pollen beetle DNA. Implications of these results for conservation biological control and future studies of food webs in OSR are discussed.},

Our analyses of whole-genome data reveal an average generation time of 26.9 years across the past 250,000 years, with fathers consistently older (30.7 years) than mothers (23.2 years). Shifts in sex-averaged generation times have been driven primarily by changes to the age of paternity, although we report a substantial increase in female generation times in the recent past. We also find a large difference in generation times among populations, reaching back to a time when all humans occupied Africa.

In this review, we provide a quantitative assessment (i.e., a meta-analysis) of tree diversity effects on insect herbivory and discuss plausible mechanisms underlying the observed patterns. We provide recommendations and working hypotheses that can serve to lay the groundwork for research to come. Based on more than 600 study cases, our quantitative review indicates that insect herbivory was, on average, lower in mixed forest stands than in pure stands, but these diversity effects were contingent on herbivore diet breadth and tree species composition. In particular, tree species diversity mainly reduced damage of specialist insect herbivores in mixed stands with phylogenetically distant tree species. Overall, our findings provide essential guidance for forest pest management.},

Whereas most specimens (92.2\%) could be unambiguously assigned to a single known species by sequence diversity at CO1, 1089 specimens (6.8\%) were assigned to more than one Barcode Index Number (BIN), creating 395 BINs which need further study to ascertain if they represent cryptic species, mitochondrial introgression, or simply regional variation in widespread species. We found 409 specimens (2.6\%) that shared a BIN assignment with another species, most involving a pair of closely allied species as 43 BINs were involved. Most of these taxa were separated by barcodes although sequence divergences were low. Only 155 specimens (0.97\%) show identical or overlapping clusters.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The origins of multicellular physiology are tied to evolution of gene expression. Genes can shift expression as organisms evolve, but how ancestral expression influences altered descendant expression is not well understood. To examine this, we amalgamate 1,903 RNA-seq datasets from 182 research projects, including 6 organs in 21 vertebrate species. Quality control eliminates project-specific biases, and expression shifts are reconstructed using gene-family-wise phylogenetic Ornstein–Uhlenbeck models. Expression shifts following gene duplication result in more drastic changes in expression properties than shifts without gene duplication. The expression properties are tightly coupled with protein evolutionary rate, depending on whether and how gene duplication occurred. Fluxes in expression patterns among organs are nonrandom, forming modular connections that are reshaped by gene duplication. Thus, if expression shifts, ancestral expression in some organs induces a strong propensity for expression in particular organs in descendants. Regardless of whether the shifts are adaptive or not, this supports a major role for what might be termed preadaptive pathways of gene expression evolution.},

            Frequency-dependent selection (FDS) is an evolutionary regime that can maintain or reduce polymorphisms. Despite the increasing availability of polymorphism data, few effective methods are available for estimating the gradient of FDS from the observed fitness components. We modeled the effects of genotype similarity on individual fitness to develop a selection gradient analysis of FDS. This modeling enabled us to estimate FDS by regressing fitness components on the genotype similarity among individuals. We detected known negative FDS on the visible polymorphism in a wild Arabidopsis and damselfly by applying this analysis to single-locus data. Further, we simulated genome-wide polymorphisms and fitness components to modify the single-locus analysis as a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The simulation showed that negative or positive FDS could be distinguished through the estimated effects of genotype similarity on simulated fitness. Moreover, we conducted the GWAS of the reproductive branch number in Arabidopsis thaliana and found that negative FDS was enriched among the top-associated polymorphisms of FDS. These results showed the potential applicability of the proposed method for FDS on both visible polymorphism and genome-wide polymorphisms. Overall, our study provides an effective method for selection gradient analysis to understand the maintenance or loss of polymorphism.},

            Implementation of genomic tools is desirable to increase the efficiency of apple breeding. Recently, the multi-environment apple reference population (apple REFPOP) proved useful for rediscovering loci, estimating genomic predictive ability, and studying genotype by environment interactions (G × E). So far, only two phenological traits were investigated using the apple REFPOP, although the population may be valuable when dissecting genetic architecture and reporting predictive abilities for additional key traits in apple breeding. Here we show contrasting genetic architecture and genomic predictive abilities for 30 quantitative traits across up to six European locations using the apple REFPOP. A total of 59 stable and 277 location-specific associations were found using GWAS, 69.2\% of which are novel when compared with 41 reviewed publications. Average genomic predictive abilities of 0.18–0.88 were estimated using main-effect univariate, main-effect multivariate, multi-environment univariate, and multi-environment multivariate models. The G × E accounted for up to 24\% of the phenotypic variability. This most comprehensive genomic study in apple in terms of trait-environment combinations provided knowledge of trait biology and prediction models that can be readily applied for marker-assisted or genomic selection, thus facilitating increased breeding efficiency.},

            Breeding of apple is a long-term and costly process due to the time and space requirements for screening selection candidates. Genomics-assisted breeding utilizes genomic and phenotypic information to increase the selection efficiency in breeding programs, and measurements of phenotypes in different environments can facilitate the application of the approach under various climatic conditions. Here we present an apple reference population: the apple REFPOP, a large collection formed of 534 genotypes planted in six European countries, as a unique tool to accelerate apple breeding. The population consisted of 269 accessions and 265 progeny from 27 parental combinations, representing the diversity in cultivated apple and current European breeding material, respectively. A high-density genome-wide dataset of 303,239 SNPs was produced as a combined output of two SNP arrays of different densities using marker imputation with an imputation accuracy of 0.95. Based on the genotypic data, linkage disequilibrium was low and population structure was weak. Two well-studied phenological traits of horticultural importance were measured. We found marker–trait associations in several previously identified genomic regions and maximum predictive abilities of 0.57 and 0.75 for floral emergence and harvest date, respectively. With decreasing SNP density, the detection of significant marker–trait associations varied depending on trait architecture. Regardless of the trait, 10,000 SNPs sufficed to maximize genomic prediction ability. We confirm the suitability of the apple REFPOP design for genomics-assisted breeding, especially for breeding programs using related germplasm, and emphasize the advantages of a coordinated and multinational effort for customizing apple breeding methods in the genomics era.},

              Genetic diversity is key to crop improvement. Owing to pervasive genomic structural variation, a single reference genome assembly cannot capture the full complement of sequence diversity of a crop species (known as the ‘pan-genome’
              1
              ). Multiple high-quality sequence assemblies are an indispensable component of a pan-genome infrastructure. Barley (
              Hordeum vulgare
              L.) is an important cereal crop with a long history of cultivation that is adapted to a wide range of agro-climatic conditions
              2
              . Here we report the construction of chromosome-scale sequence assemblies for the genotypes of 20 varieties of barley—comprising landraces, cultivars and a wild barley—that were selected as representatives of global barley diversity. We catalogued genomic presence/absence variants and explored the use of structural variants for quantitative genetic analysis through whole-genome shotgun sequencing of 300 gene bank accessions. We discovered abundant large inversion polymorphisms and analysed in detail two inversions that are frequently found in current elite barley germplasm; one is probably the product of mutation breeding and the other is tightly linked to a locus that is involved in the expansion of geographical range. This first-generation barley pan-genome makes previously hidden genetic variation accessible to genetic studies and breeding.},

              Motivation
              Multi-parent populations (MPPs) are popular for QTL mapping because they combine wide genetic diversity in parents with easy control of population structure, but a limited number of software tools for QTL mapping are specifically developed for general MPP designs.
            
            
              Results
              We developed an R package called statgenMPP, adopting a unified identity-by-descent (IBD)-based mixed model approach for QTL analysis in MPPs. The package offers easy-to-use functionalities of IBD calculations, mixed model solutions and visualizations for QTL mapping in a wide range of MPP designs, including diallele, nested-association mapping populations, multi-parent advanced genetic inter-cross populations and other complicated MPPs with known crossing schemes.
            
            
              Availability and implementation
              The R package statgenMPP is open-source and freely available on CRAN at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=statgenMPP

              In plants the hormone jasmonic acid (JA) is synthesized in response to attack by pathogens and herbivores, leading to activation of defense responses. Rapidly following JA accumulation the hormone is metabolized, presumably to prevent inhibitive effects of high JA levels on growth and development. The enzymes that directly inactivate JA were so far unknown. Here, we identify four jasmonate-induced oxygenases (JOXs) in
              Arabidopsis
              that hydroxylate jasmonic acid to form inactive 12-OH-JA. A mutant that no longer produces the four enzymes hyperaccumulates JA, exhibits reduced growth, and is highly resistant to attackers that are sensitive to JA-dependent defense. The JOX enzymes thus play an important role in determining the amplitude and duration of JA responses to balance the growth–defense trade-off.
            
          , 
            
              The phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA) is vital in plant defense and development. Although biosynthesis of JA and activation of JA-responsive gene expression by the bioactive form JA-isoleucine have been well-studied, knowledge on JA metabolism is incomplete. In particular, the enzyme that hydroxylates JA to 12-OH-JA, an inactive form of JA that accumulates after wounding and pathogen attack, is unknown. Here, we report the identification of four paralogous 2-oxoglutarate/Fe(II)–dependent oxygenases in
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              as JA hydroxylases and show that they down-regulate JA-dependent responses. Because they are induced by JA we named them
              JASMONATE-INDUCED OXYGENASES
              (
              JOXs
              ). Concurrent mutation of the four genes in a quadruple
              Arabidopsis
              mutant resulted in increased defense gene expression and increased resistance to the necrotrophic fungus
              Botrytis cinerea
              and the caterpillar
              Mamestra brassicae
              . In addition, root and shoot growth of the plants was inhibited. Metabolite analysis of leaves showed that loss of function of the four JOX enzymes resulted in overaccumulation of JA and in reduced turnover of JA into 12-OH-JA. Transformation of the quadruple mutant with each
              JOX
              gene strongly reduced JA levels, demonstrating that all four JOXs inactivate JA in plants. The in vitro catalysis of 12-OH-JA from JA by recombinant enzyme could be confirmed for three JOXs. The identification of the enzymes responsible for hydroxylation of JA reveals a missing step in JA metabolism, which is important for the inactivation of the hormone and subsequent down-regulation of JA-dependent defenses.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Glucosinolates are sulfur-rich plant secondary metabolites whose breakdown products have a wide range of biological activities in plant–herbivore and plant–pathogen interactions and anticarcinogenic properties. In Arabidopsis thaliana, hydrolysis by the enzyme, myrosinase, produces bioactive nitriles, epithionitriles, or isothiocyanates depending upon the plant's genotype and the glucosinolate's structure. A major determinant of this structural specificity is the epithiospecifier locus (ESP), whose protein causes the formation of epithionitriles and nitriles. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 3 epistatically affects nitrile formation in combination with ESP; this QTL has been termed EPITHIOSPECIFIER MODIFIER1 (ESM1). We identified a myrosinase-associated protein as the ESM1 QTL in Arabidopsis using map-based cloning with recombinant inbred lines, natural variation transcriptomic analysis, and metabolic profiling. In planta and in vitro analyses with natural ESM1 alleles, ESM1 knockouts, and overexpression lines show that ESM1 represses nitrile formation and favors isothiocyanate production. The glucosinolate hydrolysis profile change influenced by ESM1 is associated with the ability to deter herbivory by Trichoplusia ni. This gene could provide unique approaches toward improving human nutrition.},

We identify genomic regions with extreme genetic differentiation between northern and southern subpopulations and perform population structure-corrected association mapping of phenotypic traits measured in a common garden. Comparing the results of these analyses, we find that signatures of extreme subpopulation differentiation overlap strongly with phenotype association signals for overwintering and flowering time traits. Our results provide evidence that these traits were direct targets of selection during colonization and point to associated candidate genes.},

              Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identify links between individual gene variants and various traits and diseases. Unfortunately, the findings from these studies cannot be used to determine whether the gene variants associated with a disease directly cause the condition or just happen to be located near biologically relevant genes or regulatory regions.

              INTRODUCTION
              Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified thousands of human genetic variants associated with diverse diseases and traits, and most of these variants map to noncoding loci with unknown target genes and function. Current approaches to understand which GWAS loci harbor causal variants and to map these noncoding regulators to target genes suffer from low throughput. With newer multiancestry GWASs from individuals of diverse ancestries, there is a pressing and growing need to scale experimental assays to connect GWAS variants with molecular mechanisms.
              Here, we combined biobank-scale GWASs, massively parallel CRISPR screens, and single-cell sequencing to discover target genes of noncoding variants for blood trait loci with systematic targeting and inhibition of noncoding GWAS loci with single-cell sequencing (STING-seq).
            
            
              RATIONALE
              
                Blood traits are highly polygenic, and GWASs have identified thousands of noncoding loci that map to candidate
                cis
                -regulatory elements (CREs). By combining CRE-silencing CRISPR perturbations and single-cell readouts, we targeted hundreds of GWAS loci in a single assay, revealing target genes in
                cis
                and in
                trans
                . For select CREs that regulate target genes, we performed direct variant insertion. Although silencing the CRE can identify the target gene, direct variant insertion can identify magnitude and direction of effect on gene expression for the GWAS variant. In select cases in which the target gene was a transcription factor or microRNA, we also investigated the gene-regulatory networks altered upon CRE perturbation and how these networks differ across blood cell types.
              
            
            
              RESULTS
              We inhibited candidate CREs from fine-mapped blood trait GWAS variants (from {\textasciitilde}750,000 individual of diverse ancestries) in human erythroid progenitors. In total, we targeted 543 variants (254 loci) mapping to candidate CREs, generating multimodal single-cell data including transcriptome, direct CRISPR gRNA capture, and cell surface proteins.
              
                We identified target genes in
                cis
                (within 500 kb) for 134 CREs. In most cases, we found that the target gene was the closest gene and that specific enhancer-associated biochemical hallmarks (H3K27ac and accessible chromatin) are essential for CRE function. Using multiple perturbations at the same locus, we were able to distinguished between causal variants from noncausal variants in linkage disequilibrium. For a subset of validated CREs, we also inserted specific GWAS variants using base-editing STING-seq (beeSTING-seq) and quantified the effect size and direction of GWAS variants on gene expression. Given our transcriptome-wide data, we examined dosage effects in
                cis
                and
                trans
                in cases in which the
                cis
                target is a transcription factor or microRNA. We found that
                trans
                target genes are also enriched for GWAS loci, and identified gene clusters within
                trans
                gene networks with distinct biological functions and expression patterns in primary human blood cells.
              
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              In this work, we investigated noncoding GWAS variants at scale, identifying target genes in single cells. These methods can help to address the variant-to-function challenges that are a barrier for translation of GWAS findings (e.g., drug targets for diseases with a genetic basis) and greatly expand our ability to understand mechanisms underlying GWAS loci.
              
                
                  Identifying causal variants and their target genes with STING-seq.
                  
                    Uncovering causal variants and their target genes or function are a major challenge for GWASs. STING-seq combines perturbation of noncoding loci with multimodal single-cell sequencing to profile hundreds of GWAS loci in parallel. This approach can identify target genes in
                    cis
                    and
                    trans

              Background
              
                Apple (
                Malus
                x
                domestica
                Borkh.) is one of the most important fruit tree crops of temperate areas, with great economic and cultural value. Apple cultivars can be maintained for centuries in plant collections through grafting, and some are thought to date as far back as Roman times. Molecular markers provide a means to reconstruct pedigrees and thus shed light on the recent history of migration and trade of biological materials. The objective of the present study was to identify relationships within a set of over 1400 mostly old apple cultivars using whole-genome SNP data ({\textasciitilde} 253 K SNPs) in order to reconstruct pedigrees.
              
            
            
              Results
              Using simple exclusion tests, based on counting the number of Mendelian errors, more than one thousand parent-offspring relations and 295 complete parent-offspring families were identified. Additionally, a grandparent couple was identified for the missing parental side of 26 parent-offspring pairings. Among the 407 parent-offspring relations without a second identified parent, 327 could be oriented because one of the individuals was an offspring in a complete family or by using historical data on parentage or date of recording. Parents of emblematic cultivars such as ‘Ribston Pippin’, ‘White Transparent’ and ‘Braeburn’ were identified. The overall pedigree combining all the identified relationships encompassed seven generations and revealed a major impact of two Renaissance cultivars of French and English origin, namely ‘Reinette Franche’ and ‘Margil’, and one North-Eastern Europe cultivar from the 1700s, ‘Alexander’. On the contrary, several older cultivars, from the Middle Ages or the Roman times, had no, or only single, identifiable offspring in the set of studied accessions. Frequent crosses between cultivars originating from different European regions were identified, especially from the nineteenth century onwards.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The availability of over 1400 apple genotypes, previously filtered for genetic uniqueness and providing a broad representation of European germplasm, has been instrumental for the success of this large pedigree reconstruction. It enlightens the history of empirical selection and recent breeding of apple cultivars in Europe and provides insights to speed-up future breeding and selection.},

Furthermore, natural selection within the field population favored alternative alleles from year to year. Our results suggest that environmental fluctuations and selective trade-offs maintain polygenic trait variation within populations and also contribute to the geographic divergence in this wildflower species.},

            Biodiversity conservation supporting a global sustainability transformation must be inclusive, equitable, just and embrace plural values. The conservation basic income (CBI), a proposed unconditional cash transfer to individuals residing in important conservation areas, is a potentially powerful mechanism for facilitating this radical shift in conservation. This analysis provides comprehensive projections for potential gross costs of global CBI using spatial analyses of three plausible future conservation scenarios. Gross costs vary widely, depending on the areas and populations included, from US\$351 billion to US\$6.73 trillion annually. A US\$5.50 per day CBI in existing protected areas in low- and middle-income countries would cost US\$478 billion annually. These costs are large compared with current government conservation spending ({\textasciitilde}US\$133 billion in 2020) but represent a potentially sensible investment in safeguarding incalculable social and natural values and the estimated US\$44 trillion in global economic production dependent on nature.},

	abstract = {▪ Abstract  The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coexistence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover.},

We examine the consequences of a short but extreme heatwave in Oregon populations of the common yellow monkeyflower (Mimulus guttatus) by leveraging a common garden experiment planted with range wide populations and observational studies of eleven local populations. In the common garden, 89\% of seedlings died during the heatwave including {\textgreater}96\% of seedlings from geographically local populations. Some populations from hotter and drier environments had higher fitness, however others from comparable environments performed poorly. Observational studies of local natural populations drastically differed in the consequences of the heatwave: one population was completely extirpated and nearly half had a {\textgreater}50\% decrease in fitness. However, a few populations had greater fitness during the heatwave year. Differences in mortality corresponded to the impact of the heatwave on soil moisture where retention of soil moisture throughout the heatwave led to greater survivorship. Our results suggest that not all populations experience the same intensity or degree of mortality during extreme events and such heterogeneity could be important for genetic rescue or to facilitate the distribution of adaptive variants throughout the region.},

            Deleterious genetic variation is maintained in populations at low frequencies. Under a model of stabilizing selection, rare (and presumably deleterious) genetic variants are associated with increase or decrease in gene expression from some intermediate optimum. We investigate this phenomenon in a population of largely Oryza sativa ssp. indica rice landraces under normal unstressed wet and stressful drought field conditions. We include single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertion/deletion mutations, and structural variants in our analysis and find a stronger association between rare variants and gene expression outliers under the stress condition. We also show an association of the strength of this rare variant effect with linkage, gene expression levels, network connectivity, local recombination rate, and fitness consequence scores, consistent with the stabilizing selection model of gene expression.},

            The reproductive success of flowering plants with generalized pollination systems is influenced by interactions with a diverse pollinator community and abiotic factors. However, knowledge about the adaptative potential of plants to complex ecological networks and the underlying genetic mechanisms is still limited. Based on a pool-sequencing approach of 21 natural populations of Brassica incana in Southern Italy, we combined a genome-environmental association analysis with a genome scan for signals of population genomic differentiation to discover genetic variants associated with the ecological variation. We identified genomic regions putatively involved in the adaptation of B. incana to the identity of local pollinator functional categories and pollinator community composition. Interestingly, we observed several shared candidate genes associated with long-tongue bees, soil texture, and temperature variation. We established a genomic map of potential generalist flowering plant local adaptation to complex biotic interactions, and the importance of considering multiple environmental factors to describe the adaptive landscape of plant populations.},

            A genome-wide association study (GWAS) is used to identify genetic markers associated with phenotypic variation. In contrast, a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) detects associations between gene expression levels and phenotypic variation. It has previously been shown that in the cross-pollinated species, maize (Zea mays), GWAS, and TWAS identify complementary sets of trait-associated genes, many of which exhibit characteristics of true positives. Here, we extend this conclusion to the self-pollinated species, Arabidopsis thaliana and soybean (Glycine max). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) can result in the identification, via GWAS, of false-positive associations. In all three analyzed plant species, most trait-associated genes identified via TWAS are well separated physically from other candidate genes. Hence, TWAS is less affected by LD than is GWAS, demonstrating that TWAS is particularly well suited for association studies in genomes with slow rates of LD decay, such as soybean. TWAS is reasonably robust to the plant organs/tissues used to determine expression levels. In summary, this study confirms that TWAS is a promising approach for accurate gene-level association mapping in plants that is complementary to GWAS, and established that TWAS can exhibit substantial advantages relative to GWAS in species with slow rates of LD decay.},

	abstract = {Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been widely used to integrate transcriptomic and genetic data to study complex human diseases. Within a test dataset lacking transcriptomic data, traditional two-stage TWAS methods first impute gene expression by creating a weighted sum that aggregates SNPs with their corresponding cis-eQTL effects on reference transcriptome. Traditional TWAS methods then employ a linear regression model to assess the association between imputed gene expression and test phenotype, thereby assuming the effect of a cis-eQTL SNP on test phenotype is a linear function of the eQTL’s estimated effect on reference transcriptome. To increase TWAS robustness to this assumption, we propose a novel Variance-Component TWAS procedure (VC-TWAS) that assumes the effects of cis-eQTL SNPs on phenotype are random (with variance proportional to corresponding reference cis-eQTL effects) rather than fixed. VC-TWAS is applicable to both continuous and dichotomous phenotypes, as well as individual-level and summary-level GWAS data. Using simulated data, we show VC-TWAS is more powerful than traditional TWAS methods based on a two-stage Burden test, especially when eQTL genetic effects on test phenotype are no longer a linear function of their eQTL genetic effects on reference transcriptome. We further applied VC-TWAS to both individual-level (N = {\textasciitilde}3.4K) and summary-level (N = {\textasciitilde}54K) GWAS data to study Alzheimer’s dementia (AD). With the individual-level data, we detected 13 significant risk genes including 6 known GWAS risk genes such as
              TOMM40
              that were missed by traditional TWAS methods. With the summary-level data, we detected 57 significant risk genes considering only cis-SNPs and 71 significant genes considering both cis- and trans- SNPs, which also validated our findings with the individual-level GWAS data. Our VC-TWAS method is implemented in the TIGAR tool for public use.},

              Motivation
              Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been successful in identifying many genetic variants associated with complex traits. However, the mechanistic links between these variants and complex traits remain elusive. A scientific hypothesis is that genetic variants influence complex traits at the organismal level via affecting cellular traits, such as regulating gene expression and altering protein abundance. Although earlier works have already presented some scientific insights about this hypothesis and their findings are very promising, statistical methods that effectively harness multilayered data (e.g. genetic variants, cellular traits and organismal traits) on a large scale for functional and mechanistic exploration are highly demanding.
            
            
              Results
              In this study, we propose a collaborative mixed model (CoMM) to investigate the mechanistic role of associated variants in complex traits. The key idea is built upon the emerging scientific evidence that genetic effects at the cellular level are much stronger than those at the organismal level. Briefly, CoMM combines two models: the first model relating gene expression with genotype and the second model relating phenotype with predicted gene expression using the first model. The two models are fitted jointly in CoMM, such that the uncertainty in predicting gene expression has been fully accounted. To demonstrate the advantages of CoMM over existing methods, we conducted extensive simulation studies, and also applied CoMM to analyze 25 traits in NFBC1966 and Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging (GERA) studies by integrating transcriptome information from the Genetic European in Health and Disease (GEUVADIS) Project. The results indicate that by leveraging regulatory information, CoMM can effectively improve the power of prioritizing risk variants. Regarding the computational efficiency, CoMM can complete the analysis of NFBC1966 dataset and GERA datasets in 2 and 18 min, respectively.

            Mendelian randomization (MR) has emerged as a major tool for the investigation of causal relationship among traits, utilizing results from large-scale genome-wide association studies. Bias due to horizontal pleiotropy, however, remains a major concern. We propose a novel approach for robust and efficient MR analysis using large number of genetic instruments, based on a novel spike-detection algorithm under a normal-mixture model for underlying effect-size distributions. Simulations show that the new method, MRMix, provides nearly unbiased or/and less biased estimates of causal effects compared to alternative methods and can achieve higher efficiency than comparably robust estimators. Application of MRMix to publicly available datasets leads to notable observations, including identification of causal effects of BMI and age-at-menarche on the risk of breast cancer; no causal effect of HDL and triglycerides on the risk of coronary artery disease; a strong detrimental effect of BMI on the risk of major depressive disorder.},

            Many plants synchronize their life cycles in response to changing seasons and initiate flowering under favourable environmental conditions to ensure reproductive success. To confer a robust seasonal response, plants use diverse genetic programmes that integrate environmental and endogenous cues and converge on central floral regulatory hubs. Technological advances have allowed us to understand these complex processes more completely.

            Intraspecific genetic diversity is an important component of biodiversity. A substantial body of evidence has demonstrated positive effects of plant genetic diversity on plant performance. However, it has remained unclear whether plant genetic diversity generally increases plant performance by reducing the pressure of plant antagonists across trophic levels for different plant life forms, ecosystems and climatic zones. Here, we analyse 4702 effect sizes reported in 413 studies that consider effects of plant genetic diversity on trophic groups and their interactions. We found that that increasing plant genetic diversity decreased the performance of plant antagonists including invertebrate herbivores, weeds, plant-feeding nematodes and plant diseases, while increasing the performance of plants and natural enemies of herbivores. Structural equation modelling indicated that plant genetic diversity increased plant performance partly by reducing plant antagonist pressure. These results reveal that plant genetic diversity often influences multiple trophic levels in ways that enhance natural pest control in managed ecosystems and consumer control of plants in natural ecosystems for sustainable plant production.},

	abstract = {Plants produce diverse metabolites to cope with the challenges presented by complex and ever-changing environments. These challenges drive the diversification of specialized metabolites within and between plant species. However, we are just beginning to understand how frequently new alleles arise controlling specialized metabolite diversity and how the geographic distribution of these alleles may be structured by ecological and demographic pressures. Here, we measure the variation in specialized metabolites across a population of 797 natural
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              accessions. We show that a combination of geography, environmental parameters, demography and different genetic processes all combine to influence the specific chemotypes and their distribution. This showed that causal loci in specialized metabolism contain frequent independently generated alleles with patterns suggesting potential within-species convergence. This provides a new perspective about the complexity of the selective forces and mechanisms that shape the generation and distribution of allelic variation that may influence local adaptation.
            
          , 
            Since plants cannot move, they have evolved chemical defenses to help them respond to changes in their surroundings. For example, where animals run from predators, plants may produce toxins to put predators off. This approach is why plants are such a rich source of drugs, poisons, dyes and other useful substances. The chemicals plants produce are known as specialized metabolites, and they can change a lot between, and even within, plant species. The variety of specialized metabolites is a result of genetic changes and evolution over millions of years.
            Evolution is a slow process, yet plants are able to rapidly develop new specialized metabolites to protect them from new threats. Even different populations of the same species produce many distinct metabolites that help them survive in their surroundings. However, the factors that lead plants to produce new metabolites are not well understood, and it is not known how this affects genetic variation.
            
              To gain a better understanding of this process, Katz et al. studied 797 European variants of a common weed species called
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              , which is widely studied. The investigation found that many factors affect the range of specialized metabolites in each variant. These included local geography and environment, as well as genetics and population history (demography). Katz et al. revealed a pattern of relationships between the variants that could mirror their evolutionary history as the species spread and adapted to new locations.
            
            These results highlight the complex network of factors that affect plant evolution. Rapid diversification is key to plant survival in new and changing environments and has resulted in a wide range of specialized metabolites. As such they are of interest both for studying plant evolution and for understanding their ecology. Expanding similar work to more populations and other species will broaden the scope of our ability to understand how plants adapt to their surroundings.},

            Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has improved our understanding of complex traits, but challenges exist in distinguishing causation versus association caused by linkage disequilibrium. Instead, transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) detect direct associations between expression levels and phenotypic variations, providing an opportunity to better prioritize candidate genes. To assess the feasibility of TWAS, we investigated the association between transcriptomes, genomes, and various traits in Arabidopsis, including flowering time. The associated genes formerly known to regulate growth allometry or metabolite production were first identified by TWAS. Next, for flowering time, six TWAS-newly identified genes were functionally validated. Analysis of the expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) further revealed a trans-regulatory hotspot affecting the expression of several TWAS-identified genes. The hotspot covers the FRIGIDA (FRI) gene body, which possesses multiple haplotypes differentially affecting the expression of downstream genes, such as FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1 (SOC1). We also revealed multiple independent paths towards the loss of function of FRI in natural accessions. Altogether, this study demonstrates the potential of combining TWAS with eQTL analysis to identify important regulatory modules of FRI-FLC-SOC1 for quantitative traits in natural populations.},

              In plant communities, diversity often increases productivity and functioning, but the specific underlying drivers are difficult to identify. Most ecological theories attribute positive diversity effects to complementary niches occupied by different species or genotypes. However, the specific nature of niche complementarity often remains unclear, including how it is expressed in terms of trait differences between plants. Here, we use a gene-centred approach to study positive diversity effects in mixtures of natural
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              genotypes. Using two orthogonal genetic mapping approaches, we find that between-plant allelic differences at the
              AtSUC8
              locus are strongly associated with mixture overyielding.
              AtSUC8
              encodes a proton-sucrose symporter and is expressed in root tissues. Genetic variation in
              AtSUC8
              affects the biochemical activities of protein variants and natural variation at this locus is associated with different sensitivities of root growth to changes in substrate pH. We thus speculate that - in the particular case studied here - evolutionary divergence along an edaphic gradient resulted in the niche complementarity between genotypes that now drives overyielding in mixtures. Identifying genes important for ecosystem functioning may ultimately allow linking ecological processes to evolutionary drivers, help identify traits underlying positive diversity effects, and facilitate the development of high-performance crop variety mixtures.},

              Some human genetic variants affect the amount of RNA produced and the splicing of gene transcripts, crucial steps in development and maintaining a healthy individual. However, some of these changes only occur in a small number of tissues within the body. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project has been expanded over time, and, looking at the final data in version 8, Aguet
              et al.
              present a deep characterization of genetic associations and gene expression and splicing in 838 individuals over 49 tissues (see the Perspective by Wilson). This large study was able to characterize the details underlying many aspects of gene expression and provides a resource with which to better understand the fundamental molecular mechanisms of how genetic variants affect gene regulation and complex traits in humans.

            The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project was established to characterize genetic effects on the transcriptome across human tissues and to link these regulatory mechanisms to trait and disease associations. Here, we present analyses of the version 8 data, examining 15,201 RNA-sequencing samples from 49 tissues of 838 postmortem donors. We comprehensively characterize genetic associations for gene expression and splicing in cis and trans, showing that regulatory associations are found for almost all genes, and describe the underlying molecular mechanisms and their contribution to allelic heterogeneity and pleiotropy of complex traits. Leveraging the large diversity of tissues, we provide insights into the tissue specificity of genetic effects and show that cell type composition is a key factor in understanding gene regulatory mechanisms in human tissues.},

By combining whole-genome sequencing and nontarget metabolome analyses, we identified a large number of novel associations between genetic variants and plasma metabolites. Of the identified metabolite-associated genes, approximately half have already been shown to be involved in various diseases. We identified metabolite-associated genes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, some of which are from intestinal microorganisms, indicating that the identified genetic variants also markedly influence the interaction between the host and symbiotic bacteria. We also identified five associations that appeared to be female-specific. A number of rare variants that influence metabolite levels were also found, and combinations of common and rare variants influenced the metabolite levels more profoundly.

We apply this framework to 44 GTEx tissues and 100+ phenotypes from GWAS and meta-analysis studies, creating a growing public catalog of associations that seeks to capture the effects of gene expression variation on human phenotypes. Replication in an independent cohort is shown. Most of the associations are tissue specific, suggesting context specificity of the trait etiology. Colocalized significant associations in unexpected tissues underscore the need for an agnostic scanning of multiple contexts to improve our ability to detect causal regulatory mechanisms. Monogenic disease genes are enriched among significant associations for related traits, suggesting that smaller alterations of these genes may cause a spectrum of milder phenotypes.},

              Persistent infection, wherein a pathogen is continually present in a host individual, is widespread in virus–host systems. However, little is known regarding how seasonal environments alter virus–host interaction during such metastability. We observed a lineage-to-lineage infection of the host plant
              Arabidopsis halleri
              with
              Turnip mosaic virus
              for 3 years without severe damage. Virus dynamics and virus–host interactions within hosts were highly season dependent. Virus accumulation in the newly formed leaves was temperature dependent and was suppressed during winter. Transcriptome analyses suggested that distinct defence mechanisms, i.e. salicylic acid (SA)-dependent resistance and RNA silencing, were predominant during spring and autumn, respectively. Transcriptomic difference between infected and uninfected plants other than defence genes appeared transiently only during autumn in upper leaves. However, the virus preserved in the lower leaves is transferred to the clonal offspring of the host plants during spring. In the linage-to-linage infection of the
              A. halleri
              –TuMV system, both host clonal reproduction and virus transmission into new clonal rosettes are secured during the winter–spring transition. How virus and host overwinter turned out to be critical for understanding a long-term virus–host interaction within hosts under temperate climates, and more generally, understanding seasonality provides new insight into ecology of plant viruses.},

Empirical research, however, has traditionally focused on understanding differences in means and overlooked the theoretically significant ecological and evolutionary roles of variability itself. We review the literature with the goal of showing how variability-explicit research expands our perspective on plant–herbivore ecology and evolution. We first clarify terminology for describing variation and then review patterns, causes, and consequences of variation in herbivory across scales of space, time, and biological organization. We consider how incorporating variability improves existing hypotheses and leads to new ones. We conclude by suggesting future work that reports full distributions, integrates effects of variation across scales, describes nonlinearities, and considers how stochastic and deterministic variation combine to determine herbivory distributions.

                  Species differ dramatically in their prevalence in the natural world, with many species characterized as rare due to restricted geographic distribution, low local abundance and/or habitat specialization.
                
                
                  We investigated the ecoevolutionary causes and consequences of rarity with phylogenetically controlled metaanalyses of population genetic diversity, fitness and functional traits in rare and common congeneric plant species. Our syntheses included 252 rare species and 267 common congeners reported in 153 peer‐reviewed articles published from 1978 to 2020 and one manuscript in press.
                
                
                  Rare species have reduced population genetic diversity, depressed fitness and smaller reproductive structures than common congeners. Rare species also could suffer from inbreeding depression and reduced fertilization efficiency.
                
                
                  By limiting their capacity to adapt and migrate, these characteristics could influence contemporary patterns of rarity and increase the susceptibility of rare species to rapid environmental change. We recommend that future studies present more nuanced data on the extent of rarity in focal species, expose rare and common species to ecologically relevant treatments, including reciprocal transplants, and conduct quantitative genetic and population genomic analyses across a greater array of systems. This research could elucidate the processes that contribute to rarity and generate robust predictions of extinction risks under global change.},

            A major determinant of flowering time in natural Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) variants is FRIGIDA (FRI). FRI up-regulates expression of the floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), thereby conferring a vernalization requirement and a winter annual habit. FRI encodes a novel nuclear protein with no conserved domains except for two coiled-coil regions. A mutation in the large subunit of the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) suppresses FRI activity, so we have explored the connection between FRI and the nuclear CBC in order to gain further insight into FRI biochemical activity. Mutations in the small subunit of the CBC (CBP20) also suppress FRI up-regulation of FLC. CBP20 interacted directly with FRI in yeast and in planta, and this association of FRI with the 5′ cap was reinforced by an RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends assay that showed FRI decreased the proportion of FLC transcripts lacking a 5′ cap. Loss of CBP20 resulted in very low FLC mRNA levels and an increased proportion of unspliced FLC transcripts. FRI compensated for CBP20 loss, partially restoring FLC levels and normalizing the unspliced-spliced transcript ratio. Our data suggest that FRI up-regulates FLC expression through a cotranscriptional mechanism involving direct physical interaction with the nuclear CBC with concomitant effects on FLC transcription and splicing.},

                  The genetic basis of flowering time changes across environments, and pleiotropy may limit adaptive evolution of populations in response to local conditions. However, little information is known about how genetic architecture changes among environments.
                
                
                  
                    We used genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) in
                    Boechera stricta
                    (Graham) Al‐Shehbaz, a relative of Arabidopsis, to examine flowering variation among environments and associations with climate conditions in home environments. Also, we used molecular population genetics to search for evidence of historical natural selection.
                  
                
                
                  GWAS found 47 significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that influence flowering time in one or more environments, control plastic changes in phenology between experiments, or show associations with climate in sites of origin. Genetic architecture of flowering varied substantially among environments. We found that some pairs of QTLs showed similar patterns of pleiotropy across environments. A large‐effect QTL showed molecular signatures of adaptive evolution and is associated with climate in home environments. The derived allele at this locus causes later flowering and predominates in sites with greater water availability.
                
                
                  This work shows that GWAS of climate associations and ecologically important traits across diverse environments can be combined with molecular signatures of natural selection to elucidate ecological genetics of adaptive evolution.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            The role of the Arabidopsis homeobox gene, GLABRA 2 (GL2), in the development of the root epidermis has been investigated. The wild-type epidermis is composed of two cell types, root-hair cells and hairless cells, which are located at distinct positions within the root, implying that positional cues control cell-type differentiation. During the development of the root epidermis, the differentiating root-hair cells (trichoblasts) and the differentiating hairless cells (atrichoblasts) can be distinguished by their cytoplasmic density, vacuole formation, and extent of elongation. We have determined that mutations in the GL2 gene specifically alter the differentiation of the hairless epidermal cells, causing them to produce root hairs, which indicates that GL2 affects epidermal cell identity. Detailed analyses of these differentiating cells showed that, despite forming root hairs, they are similar to atrichoblasts of the wild type in their cytoplasmic characteristics, timing of vacuolation, and extent of cell elongation. The results of in situ nucleic acid hybridization and GUS reporter gene fusion studies show that the GL2 gene is preferentially expressed in the differentiating hairless cells of the wild type, during a period in which epidermal cell identity is believed to be established. These results indicate that the GL2 homeodomain protein normally regulates a subset of the processes that occur during the differentiation of hairless epidermal cells of the Arabidopsis root. Specifically, GL2 appears to act in a cell-position-dependent manner to suppress hair formation in differentiating hairless cells.},

The initial selection of trichome precursors requires the activity of both the GLABROUS1 (GL1) and TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABROUS (TTG) genes. The GLABRA2 (GL2) gene is required for subsequent phases of trichome morphogenesis such as cell expansion, branching, and maturation of the trichome cell wall. Previous studies have shown that GL2 is a member of the homeodomain class of transcription factors. Here we report a detailed analysis of GL2 expression in the shoot using anti-GL2 antibodies and the GUS reporter gene fused to the GL2 promoter. The GL2 expression profile in the shoot is complex, and involves spatial and temporal variation in developing leaves and trichomes. Two separate promoter domains that are expressed in trichomes were identified. GL2, like GL1, is expressed in developing trichomes and in cells surrounding trichomes during early stages of trichome development. Unlike GL1, GL2 expression persists in mature trichomes. It was found that while GL1 and TTG were not required for the initiation of GL2 expression in the non-trichome cells, the presence of a functional GL1 or TTG gene was able to increase GL2 expression in these cells compared to ttg gl1 plants. The hypothesis that GL1 regulates aspects of GL2 expression is consistent with epistatic analysis of gl1 and gl2 and the expression patterns of GL1 and GL2. In support of this hypothesis, it was found that ectopic expression of GL1 in the presence of ectopic expression of the maize R gene, which can bypass the requirement for TTG, can ectopically activate GL2 transcription.},

This discrepancy may partially arise from limitations presented by geographically diverse mapping panels. Properties of metabolic pathways that impede GWAS by diluting the additive effect of a causal variant, such as allelic and genetic heterogeneity and epistasis, would be expected to increase in severity with the geographical range of the mapping panel. We hypothesized that a population from a single locality would reveal an expanded set of associated loci. We tested this in a French

              population (less than 1 km transect) by profiling and conducting GWAS for glucosinolates, a suite of defensive metabolites that have been studied in depth through functional and genetic mapping approaches. For two distinct classes of glucosinolates, we discovered more associations at biosynthetic loci than the previous GWAS with continental-scale mapping panels. Candidate genes underlying novel associations were supported by concordance between their observed effects in the TOU-A population and previous functional genetic and biochemical characterization. Local populations complement geographically diverse mapping panels to reveal a more complete genetic architecture for metabolic traits.

            Ensuring food security for an ever-growing global population while adapting to climate change is the main challenge for agriculture in the 21st century. Although new technologies are being applied to tackle this problem, we are approaching a plateau in crop improvement using conventional breeding. Recent advances in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene engineering have paved the way to accelerate plant breeding to meet this increasing demand. However, many traits are governed by multiple small-effect genes operating in complex interactive networks. Here, we present the gene discovery pipeline BREEDIT, which combines multiplex genome editing of whole gene families with crossing schemes to improve complex traits such as yield and drought tolerance. We induced gene knockouts in 48 growth-related genes into maize (Zea mays) using CRISPR/Cas9 and generated a collection of over 1,000 gene-edited plants. The edited populations displayed (on average) 5\%–10\% increases in leaf length and up to 20\% increases in leaf width compared with the controls. For each gene family, edits in subsets of genes could be associated with enhanced traits, allowing us to reduce the gene space to be considered for trait improvement. BREEDIT could be rapidly applied to generate a diverse collection of mutants to identify promising gene modifications for later use in breeding programs.},

            Components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRTs) were first identified in a genetic screen in budding yeast as factors interfering with vacuolar protein sorting. In the last three decades, intensive studies have revealed the subunit composition of ESCRT-0, ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II, ESCRT-III, their structure, the assembling mechanisms and their molecular and physiological functions. In plants, ESCRTs are essential for development, growth and stress responses. ESCRTs are best known for their function in endosomal trafficking, during which they are required for sorting ubiquitylated membrane proteins into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of multivesicular endosomes (MVEs). The formation of ILVs requires the function of ESCRT-III, which has been shown to mediate the membrane scission. Although the function of plant ESCRTs has been predominantly discussed in the context of endosomal trafficking, recent studies in other model organisms revealed a versatile role of ESCRTs in diverse cellular events with broad physiological implications. The non-endosomal functions of ESCRTs include cytokinesis, viral budding, autophagy, nuclear envelope reformation and membrane repair, although many of these have not yet been studied in plants. In this review, recent findings on non-endosomal ESCRT functions in plant, yeast and animals are highlighted and discussed.},

            Grafting is a means to connect tissues from two individual plants and grow a single chimeric plant through the establishment of both apoplasmic and symplasmic connections. Recent molecular studies using RNA-sequencing data have provided genetic information on the processes involved in tissue reunion, including wound response, cell division, cell–cell adhesion, cell differentiation and vascular formation. Thus, studies on grafting increase our understanding of various aspects of plant biology. Grafting has also been used to study systemic signaling and transport of micromolecules and macromolecules in the plant body. Given that graft viability and molecular transport across graft junctions largely depend on vascular formation, a major focus in grafting biology has been the mechanism of vascular development. In addition, it has been thought that symplasmic connections via plasmodesmata are fundamentally important to share cellular information among newly proliferated cells at the graft interface and to accomplish tissue differentiation correctly. Therefore, this review focuses on plasmodesmata formation during grafting. We take advantage of interfamily grafts for unambiguous identification of the graft interface and summarize morphological aspects of de novo formation of plasmodesmata. Important molecular events are addressed by re-examining the time-course transcriptome of interfamily grafts, from which we recently identified the cell–cell adhesion mechanism. Plasmodesmata-associated genes upregulated during graft healing that may provide a link to symplasm establishment are described. We also discuss future research directions.},

            A currently popular strategy (EMMAX) for genome-wide association (GWA) analysis infers association for the specific marker of interest by treating its effect as fixed while treating all other marker effects as classical Gaussian random effects. It may be more statistically coherent to specify all markers as sharing the same prior distribution, whether that distribution is Gaussian, heavy-tailed (BayesA), or has variable selection specifications based on a mixture of, say, two Gaussian distributions [stochastic search and variable selection (SSVS)]. Furthermore, all such GWA inference should be formally based on posterior probabilities or test statistics as we present here, rather than merely being based on point estimates. We compared these three broad categories of priors within a simulation study to investigate the effects of different degrees of skewness for quantitative trait loci (QTL) effects and numbers of QTL using 43,266 SNP marker genotypes from 922 Duroc–Pietrain F2-cross pigs. Genomic regions were based either on single SNP associations, on nonoverlapping windows of various fixed sizes (0.5–3 Mb), or on adaptively determined windows that cluster the genome into blocks based on linkage disequilibrium. We found that SSVS and BayesA lead to the best receiver operating curve properties in almost all cases. We also evaluated approximate maximum a posteriori (MAP) approaches to BayesA and SSVS as potential computationally feasible alternatives; however, MAP inferences were not promising, particularly due to their sensitivity to starting values. We determined that it is advantageous to use variable selection specifications based on adaptively constructed genomic window lengths for GWA studies.},

              Genome‐wide association (
              GWA
              ) studies based on
              GBLUP
              models are a common practice in animal breeding. However, effect sizes of
              GWA
              tests are small, requiring larger sample sizes to enhance power of detection of rare variants. Because of difficulties in increasing sample size in animal populations, one alternative is to implement a meta‐analysis (
              MA
              ), combining information and results from independent
              GWA
              studies. Although this methodology has been used widely in human genetics, implementation in animal breeding has been limited. Thus, we present methods to implement a
              MA
              of
              GWA
              , describing the proper approach to compute weights derived from multiple genomic evaluations based on animal‐centric
              GBLUP
              models. Application to real datasets shows that
              MA
              increases power of detection of associations in comparison with population‐level
              GWA
              , allowing for population structure and heterogeneity of variance components across populations to be accounted for. Another advantage of
              MA
              is that it does not require access to genotype data that is required for a joint analysis. Scripts related to the implementation of this approach, which consider the strength of association as well as the sign, are distributed and thus account for heterogeneity in association phase between
              QTL
              and
              SNP
              s. Thus,
              MA
              of
              GWA
              is an attractive alternative to summarizing results from multiple genomic studies, avoiding restrictions with genotype data sharing, definition of fixed effects and different scales of measurement of evaluated traits.},

Genomic data offer a newly available window to diversity, complementary to other measures like taxonomic or phenotypic diversity. We tested whether native genetic diversity in field experimental stands of
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              affected their aboveground biomass and fecundity in their colonized range. We constructed some stands of genotypes that we
              a priori
              predicted would differ in performance or show overyielding. We found no relationship between genetic diversity and stand total biomass. However, increasing stand genetic diversity increased fecundity in high-resource conditions. Polyculture (multiple genotype) stands consistently yielded less biomass than expected based on the yields of component genotypes in monoculture. This under-yielding was strongest in stands with late-flowering and high biomass genotypes, potentially due to interference competition by these genotypes. Using a new implementation of association mapping, we identified genetic loci whose diversity was associated with stand-level yield, revealing a major flowering time locus associated with under-yielding of polycultures. Our field experiment supports community ecology studies that find a range of diversity-function relationships. Nevertheless, our results suggest diversity in colonizing propagule pools can enhance population fitness. Furthermore, interference competition among genotypes differing in flowering time might limit the advantages of polyculture.},

                  The optimal foraging theory, the nutrient balance hypothesis, and the plant association theories predict that foraging decisions and resulting tree damage by large mammalian browsers may be influenced by the species richness and species composition of forest stands. This may lead to either associational susceptibility (increased damage on a focal plant in a mixed stand) or associational resistance (reduced damage in a mixed stand).
                
                
                  Better understanding of the mechanisms and the relative importance of tree species richness and composition effects on foraging by mammalian browsers is needed to support sustainable management of forests and mammal populations. However, existing knowledge of forest diversity effects on foraging by large mammalian browsers comes largely from observational studies while experimental evidence is limited.
                
                
                  
                    We analysed winter browsing by moose (
                    Alces alces
                    L.) in a long‐term, large‐scale experiment in Finland, which represents a tree species richness gradient from monocultures to 2‐, 3‐ and 5‐species mixtures composed of Scots pine (
                    Pinus sylvestris
                    L.
                    )
                    , Norway spruce (
                    Picea abies
                    L.), Siberian larch (
                    Larix sibirica
                    Ledeb.), silver birch (
                    Betula pendula
                    Roth.) and black alder (
                    Alnus glutinosa
                    L.).
                  
                
                
                  The intensity of browsing per plot increased with tree species richness while browsing selectivity decreased with tree species being targeted more equally in species‐rich mixtures. Tree species composition of a plot was also an important determinant of intensity of browsing. The greatest browsing occurred in plots containing preferred species (pine and birch) while intermediate preference species (larch and alder) experienced associational susceptibility when growing with pine and birch compared with their monocultures or mixtures without pine and birch. In contrast, we found no evidence of associational resistance; the presence of a least preferred species (spruce) in a mixture had no significant effect on moose browsing on other tree species.
                
                
                  We demonstrate that the presence of alternative forage species allows moose to spend longer opportunistically foraging in a plot, resulting in increased level of damage in species‐rich stands and stands containing preferred tree species. Our results highlight the limitations of the optimal foraging theory in predicting browsing patterns and demonstrate the importance of associational effects within mixed stands.},

	abstract = {The effects of vegetational diversity on the abundance of natural enemies of herbivores were studied in a traditional agroecosystem in tropical Mexico. Visitation patterns of parasitic Hymenoptera and densities of predators were compared between monocultures of squash and maize and mixed assemblages of maize, cowpea, and squash. The impact of parasitoid visitation was assessed by monitoring the percent parasitism of a target herbivore in the system: Diaphania hyalinata (L.) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), a cucurbit specialist. The "Enemies" hypothesis predicts a positive correlation between plant species richness and natural enemy abundance, which results in the regulation of herbivores at lower levels in diverse vegetation than in pure stands. The specific questions addressed in this study were: (1) are the major groups of natural enemies more abundant in patches of diverse vegetation than in monocultures?; (2) if so, does an increase in either abundance or diversity of natural enemies cause a concomitant increase in herbivore regulation?; (3) are the effects of vegetational diversity uniform over major enemy groups? The activity of hymenopteran parasitoids was affected by cropping pattern. Malaise trap captures of parasitoids in general, and of those species that attack D. hyalinata on squash, were consistently greater in tricultures than in squash monocultures, but were also greater in maize monocultures. Parasitism rates of eggs and larvae were higher on squash interplanted with maize and cowpea. These data partially support the "Enemies" hypothesis in explaining lower herbivore levels in diverse vegetation. However, the effects of diversity, per se, do not seem to be as important as the presence of maize in the system. The responses of natural enemies to vegetational diversity were not uniform. Most predators were not significantly influenced by cropping patterns, and some were more abundant in squash monocultures. The results of this study are discussed in terms of possible routes by which members of the third trophic level are influenced by plants in association.},

	abstract = {Plants are daily challenged by multiple abiotic and biotic stresses. A major biotic constraint corresponds to competition with other plant species. Although plants simultaneously interact with multiple neighboring species throughout their life cycle, there is still very limited information about the genetics of the competitive response in the context of plurispecific interactions. Using a local mapping population of
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              , we set up a genome wide association study (GWAS) to estimate the extent of genetic variation of competitive response in 12 plant species assemblages, based on three competitor species (

              Veronica arvensis
              ). Based on five phenotypic traits, we detected strong crossing reaction norms not only between the three bispecific neighborhoods but also among the plurispecific neighborhoods. The genetic architecture of competitive response was highly dependent on the identity and the relative abundance of the neighboring species. In addition, most of the enriched biological processes underlying competitive responses largely differ among neighborhoods. While the RNA related processes might confer a broad range response toolkit for multiple traits in diverse neighborhoods, some processes, such as signaling and transport, might play a specific role in particular assemblages. Altogether, our results suggest that plants can integrate and respond to different species assemblages depending on the identity and number of each neighboring species, through a large range of candidate genes associated with diverse and unexpected processes leading to developmental and stress responses.},

These generally require plant jasmonate (JA) signaling, specifically, a jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile) burst, for their activation and are well studied in the native tobacco
              Nicotiana attenuata
              . We used intraspecific diversity captured in a 26-parent MAGIC population planted in nature and an updated genome assembly to impute natural variation in the OS-elicited JA-Ile burst linked to a mutation in the JA-Ile biosynthetic gene
              NaJAR4
              . Experiments revealed that
              NaJAR4
              variants were associated with higher fitness in the absence of herbivores but compromised foliar defenses, with two
              NaJAR
              homologues (4 and 6) complementing each other spatially and temporally. From decade-long seed collections of natural populations, we uncovered enzymatically inactive variants occurring at variable frequencies, consistent with a balancing selection regime maintaining variants. Integrative analyses of OS-induced transcriptomes and metabolomes of natural accessions revealed that
              NaJAR4
              is embedded in a nonlinear complex gene coexpression network orchestrating responses to OS, which we tested by silencing four hub genes in two connected coexpressed networks and examining their OS-elicited metabolic responses. Lines silenced in two hub genes (

Such knowledge allows one to link genetic models of trait evolution with ecological models describing interactions within and between species. Previous work has shown that connections between genetic and ecological processes in
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              may be mediated by the fact that quantitative trait loci (QTL) with ‘direct’ effects on traits of individuals also have pleiotropic ‘indirect’ effects on traits expressed in neighbouring plants. Here, we further explore these connections by examining functional relationships between traits affected directly and indirectly by the same QTL. We develop a novel approach using structural equation models (SEMs) to determine whether observed pleiotropic effects result from traits directly affected by the QTL in focal individuals causing the changes in the neighbours' phenotypes. This hypothesis was assessed using SEMs to test whether focal plant phenotypes appear to mediate the connection between the focal plants' genotypes and the phenotypes of their neighbours, or alternatively, whether the connection between the focal plants' genotypes and the neighbours' phenotypes is mediated by unmeasured traits. We implement this analysis using a QTL of major effect that maps to the well-characterized flowering locus,
              FRIGIDA
              . The SEMs support the hypothesis that the pleiotropic indirect effects of this locus arise from size and developmental timing-related traits in focal plants affecting the expression of developmental traits in their neighbours. Our findings provide empirical insights into the genetics and nature of intraspecific ecological interactions. Our technique holds promise in directing future work into the genetic basis and functional relationship of traits mediating and responding to ecological interactions.},

We used genome-wide polymorphisms of the plant species
            Arabidopsis thaliana
            to identify genotype pairs that enhance associational resistance to herbivory. By quantifying neighbor interactions among 199 genotypes grown in a randomized block design, we predicted that 823 of the 19,701 candidate pairs could reduce herbivory through associational resistance. We planted such pairs with predicted associational resistance in mixtures and monocultures and found a significant reduction in herbivore damage in the mixtures. Our study highlights the potential application to assemble genotype mixtures with positive biodiversity effects.},

The simulation showed that increasing canopy height differences and latitude led to increased shading, and the planting direction with the least shading was about 90° to 120° at the experimental site. The newly proposed SCM offers a quantitative approach for better understanding shading in intercropping systems.},

              Plant–herbivore interactions mediated by plant–plant signalling have been documented in different species but its within‐species variability has hardly been quantified. Here, we tested if herbivore foraging activity on plants was influenced by a prior contact with a damaged plant and if the effect of such plant–plant signalling was variable across 113 natural genotypes of
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              . We filmed the activity of the generalist herbivore
              Cornu aspersum
              during 1 h on two plants differing only in a prior contact with a damaged plant or not. We recorded each snails' first choice, and measured its first duration on a plant, the proportion of time spent on both plants and leaf consumption. Overall, plant–plant signalling modified the foraging activity of herbivores in
              A. thaliana
              . On average, snails spent more time and consumed more of plants that experienced a prior contact with a damaged plant. However, the effects of plant–plant signalling on snail behaviour was variable: depending on genotype identity, plant–plant signalling made undamaged plants more repellant or attractive to snails. Genome‐wide associations revealed that genes related to stress coping ability and jasmonate pathway were associated to this variation. Together, our findings highlight the adaptive significance of plant–plant signalling for plant–herbivore interactions.},

	abstract = {North America has experienced a massive increase in cropland use since 1800, accompanied more recently by the intensification of agricultural practices. Through genome analysis of present-day and historical samples spanning environments over the past two centuries, we studied the effect of these changes in farming on the extent and tempo of evolution across the native range of the common waterhemp (
              Amaranthus tuberculatus
              ), a now pervasive agricultural weed. Modern agriculture has imposed strengths of selection rarely observed in the wild, with notable shifts in allele frequency trajectories since agricultural intensification in the 1960s. An evolutionary response to this extreme selection was facilitated by a concurrent human-mediated range shift. By reshaping genome-wide diversity across the landscape, agriculture has driven the success of this weed in the 21st century.

However, we still lack understanding of their evolutionary history: the extent of parallelism in the origins of target-site resistance (TSR), how long these mutations persist, how quickly they spread, and allelic interactions that mediate their selective advantage. We addressed these questions with genomic data from 19 agricultural populations of common waterhemp (
              Amaranthus tuberculatus
              ), which we show to have undergone a massive expansion over the past century, with a contemporary effective population size estimate of 8 x 10
              7
              . We found variation at seven characterized TSR loci, two of which had multiple amino acid substitutions, and three of which were common. These three common resistance variants show extreme parallelism in their mutational origins, with gene flow having shaped their distribution across the landscape. Allele age estimates supported a strong role of adaptation from de novo mutations, with a median age of 30 suggesting that most resistance alleles arose soon after the onset of herbicide use. However, resistant lineages varied in both their age and evidence for selection over two different timescales, implying considerable heterogeneity in the forces that govern their persistence. Two such forces are intra- and inter-locus allelic interactions; we report a signal of extended haplotype competition between two common TSR alleles, and extreme linkage with genome-wide alleles with known functions in resistance adaptation. Together, this work reveals a remarkable example of spatial parallel evolution in a metapopulation, with important implications for the management of herbicide resistance.},

              Alopecurus myosuroides
              ), which is a major threat for temperate climate cereal crops. This inadvertent selection pressure provides an opportunity for investigating the underlying genetic mechanisms and evolutionary processes of rapid adaptation, which can occur both through mutations in the direct targets of herbicides and through changes in other, often metabolic, pathways, known as non-target-site resistance. How much target-site resistance (TSR) relies on de novo mutations vs. standing variation is important for developing strategies to manage herbicide resistance. We first generated a chromosome-level reference genome for
              A. myosuroides
              for population genomic studies of herbicide resistance and genome-wide diversity across Europe in this species. Next, through empirical data in the form of highly accurate long-read amplicons of alleles encoding acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) and acetolactate synthase (ALS) variants, we showed that most populations with resistance due to TSR mutations—23 out of 27 and six out of nine populations for

              and
              ALS

              Lipids play fundamental roles in regulating agronomically important traits. Advances in plant lipid metabolism have until recently largely been based on reductionist approaches, although modulation of its components can have system-wide effects. However, existing models of plant lipid metabolism provide lumped representations, hindering detailed study of component modulation. Here, we present the Plant Lipid Module (PLM) which provides a mechanistic description of lipid metabolism in the
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              rosette. We demonstrate that the PLM can be readily integrated in models of
              A. thaliana
              Col-0 metabolism, yielding accurate predictions (83\%) of single lethal knock-outs and 75\% concordance between measured transcript and predicted flux changes under extended darkness. Genome-wide associations with fluxes obtained by integrating the PLM in diel condition- and accession-specific models identify up to 65 candidate genes modulating
              A. thaliana
              lipid metabolism. Using mutant lines, we validate up to 40\% of the candidates, paving the way for identification of metabolic gene function based on models capturing natural variability in metabolism.},

Accordingly, T. camschatcense in this region must have experienced dramatic changes in population size and spatial distribution, which may have signiﬁcantly reduced seed production and genetic diversity. First, we summarize a series of life history studies on T. camschatcense. Second, we introduce approaches to understand the effects of forest fragmentation on the understory herb, T. camschatcense. Finally, we conclude that integration of data on demographic, reproductive biology and genetic approaches is essential for plant conservation, and we emphasize that it is important to have basic life history data, such as long-tem demographic data and variation in breeding system, on ‘common species’ before those species become ‘new rares’.},

Because T. camschatcense retains both selfcompatible (SC) and self-incompatible (SI) populations, the frequencies of AD plants in multiple populations (22 SC and eight SI) were examined to predict the fate of these individuals under contrasting breeding systems. Morphological and genetic analyses in a SC population demonstrated that AD plants were completely male sterile, but female fertile. Although the quantity of seed produced was similar, hermaphrodites produced seeds predominantly via selﬁng, whereas seeds of AD plants were entirely outcrossed. Because inbreeding depression was severe, AD plants achieved a ﬁtness advantage through inbreeding avoidance. However, the frequency of AD plants varied among SC populations (0–42\%), suggesting that environmental variance can modify the relative ﬁtness. Conversely, the frequency was suppressed among SI populations (0–2\%). Because SI hermaphrodites are free from inbreeding, AD plants would not beneﬁt from inbreeding avoidance and would ﬁnd it difﬁcult to invade a SI population.},

Flowering takes place in early to late April. T. camschatcense typically has three white petals and three sepals, is primarily pollinated by bumblebees (Bombus and Andrena spp.) and beetles (Carpophilus and Aphthonaltica spp.), with pollen/ovule ratios of 2200, and is a conditional outbreeder. Occasional inbreeders are also known in the northeastern populations of Hokkaido. Capsules mature in late summer, late July to August. Light-brown seeds, 2–3 mm long, with a soft juicy elaiosome containing sugars such as fructose, glucose and saccharose attracts ants and beetles, but only ants are effective dispersal agents for Trillium seeds. Our long-term monitoring study has continued for 25 years from 1980 to 2004, and most of the ﬂowering individuals turned out to be extremely long-lived, at ages of well over 20 years.

              Crop diversification is a potential strategy to increase the stability and productivity of crops, while reducing pathogen pressures and pesticide requirements. Crop variety mixtures provide some of these diversification benefits and their cultivation is fully compatible with current mechanized agronomic practices. However, the development of optimal variety mixtures is a long, labour‐intense process requiring extensive field trials. High throughput field phenotyping (HTFP) methods provide promising applications in field testing because they allow for precise, repeatable, and rapid measurements of crop properties. Here, we evaluated the use of HTFP for developing high‐performing oat (
              Avena sativa
              ) variety mixtures by testing its suitability to predict diversity yield benefits from repeated canopy measurements across the growing season. Analyzing 26 mixtures of five varieties, we found significant overyielding at harvest, that is, mixtures were on average more productive than expected based on component pure stands. This grain yield overyielding was well predicted from deviations between mixture and pure stand canopy cover estimations, derived from HTFP mid‐way through the growing season. This shows that (i) positive interactions between oat varieties occur already at an early stage, (ii) such interactions lead to increased potential for light interception, (iii) HTFP offers rapid, scalable methods to screen for performant variety mixtures.

	abstract = {Phytochemical diversity is thought to result from coevolutionary cycles as specialization in herbivores imposes diversifying selection on plant chemical defenses. Plants in the speciose genus Erysimum (Brassicaceae) produce both ancestral glucosinolates and evolutionarily novel cardenolides as defenses. Here we test macroevolutionary hypotheses on co-expression, co-regulation, and diversification of these potentially redundant defenses across this genus. We sequenced and assembled the genome of E. cheiranthoides and foliar transcriptomes of 47 additional Erysimum species to construct a phylogeny from 9868 orthologous genes, revealing several geographic clades but also high levels of gene discordance. Concentrations, inducibility, and diversity of the two defenses varied independently among species, with no evidence for trade-offs. Closely related, geographically co-occurring species shared similar cardenolide traits, but not glucosinolate traits, likely as a result of specific selective pressures acting on each defense. Ancestral and novel chemical defenses in Erysimum thus appear to provide complementary rather than redundant functions.
          , 
            Plants are often attacked by insects and other herbivores. As a result, they have evolved to defend themselves by producing many different chemicals that are toxic to these pests. As producing each chemical costs energy, individual plants often only produce one type of chemical that is targeted towards their main herbivore. Related species of plants often use the same type of chemical defense so, if a particular herbivore gains the ability to cope with this chemical, it may rapidly become an important pest for the whole plant family.
            To escape this threat, some plants have gained the ability to produce more than one type of chemical defense. Wallflowers, for example, are a group of plants in the mustard family that produce two types of toxic chemicals: mustard oils, which are common in most plants in this family; and cardenolides, which are an innovation of the wallflowers, and which are otherwise found only in distantly related plants such as foxglove and milkweed. The combination of these two chemical defenses within the same plant may have allowed the wallflowers to escape attacks from their main herbivores and may explain why the number of wallflower species rapidly increased within the last two million years.
            Züst et al. have now studied the diversity of mustard oils and cardenolides present in many different species of wallflower. This analysis revealed that almost all of the tested wallflower species produced high amounts of both chemical defenses, while only one species lacked the ability to produce cardenolides. The levels of mustard oils had no relation to the levels of cardenolides in the tested species, which suggests that the regulation of these two defenses is not linked. Furthermore, Züst et al. found that closely related wallflower species produced more similar cardenolides, but less similar mustard oils, to each other. This suggests that mustard oils and cardenolides have evolved independently in wallflowers and have distinct roles in the defense against different herbivores.
            The evolution of insect resistance to pesticides and other toxins is an important concern for agriculture. Applying multiple toxins to crops at the same time is an important strategy to slow the evolution of resistance in the pests. The findings of Züst et al. describe a system in which plants have naturally evolved an equivalent strategy to escape their main herbivores. Understanding how plants produce multiple chemical defenses, and the costs involved, may help efforts to breed crop species that are more resistant to herbivores and require fewer applications of pesticides.},

              Background
              
                Roots are essential for plant growth and have a variety of functions, such as anchoring the plant to the ground, absorbing water and nutrients from the soil, and sensing abiotic stresses, among others.
                OsERF106MZ
                is a salinity-induced gene that is expressed in germinating seeds and rice seedling roots. However, the roles of OsERF106MZ in root growth remain poorly understood.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Histochemical staining to examine β-glucuronidase (GUS) activity in transgenic rice seedlings harboring
                OsERF106MZp::GUS
                indicated that
                OsERF106MZ
                is mainly expressed in the root exodermis, sclerenchyma layer, and vascular system.
                OsERF106MZ
                overexpression in rice seedlings leads to an increase in primary root (PR) length. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is thought to act as a hidden architect of root system structure. The expression of the ABA biosynthetic gene
                OsAO3
                is downregulated in
                OsERF106MZ
                -overexpressing roots under normal conditions, while the expression of
                OsNPC3
                , an
                AtNPC4
                homolog involved in ABA sensitivity, is reduced in
                OsERF106MZ
                -overexpressing roots under both normal and NaCl-treated conditions. Under normal conditions,
                OsERF106MZ
                -overexpressing roots show a significantly reduced ABA level; moreover, exogenous application of 1.0 µM ABA can suppress OsERF106MZ-mediated root growth promotion. Additionally,
                OsERF106MZ
                -overexpressing roots display less sensitivity to ABA-mediated root growth inhibition when treated with 5.0 µM ABA under normal conditions or exposed to NaCl-treated conditions. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR and luciferase (LUC) reporter assays showed that OsERF106MZ can bind directly to the sequence containing the GCC box in the promoter region of the
                OsAO3
                gene and repress the expression of
                OsAO3

                OsERF106MZ
                may play a role in maintaining root growth for resource uptake when rice seeds germinate under salinity stress by alleviating ABA-mediated root growth inhibition.},

              The evolutionary transition to self-compatibility facilitates polyploid speciation. In
              Arabidopsis
              relatives, the self-incompatibility system is characterized by epigenetic dominance modifiers, among which small RNAs suppress the expression of a recessive
              SCR/SP11
              haplogroup. Although the contribution of dominance to polyploid self-compatibility is speculated, little functional evidence has been reported. Here we employ transgenic techniques to the allotetraploid plant
              A. kamchatica
              . We find that when the dominant
              SCR-B
              is repaired by removing a transposable element insertion, self-incompatibility is restored. This suggests that
              SCR
              was responsible for the evolution of self-compatibility. By contrast, the reconstruction of recessive
              SCR-D
              cannot restore self-incompatibility. These data indicate that the insertion in
              SCR-B
              conferred dominant self-compatibility to
              A. kamchatica
              . Dominant self-compatibility supports the prediction that dominant mutations increasing selfing rate can pass through Haldane’s sieve against recessive mutations. The dominance regulation between subgenomes inherited from progenitors contrasts with previous studies on novel epigenetic mutations at polyploidization termed genome shock.},

              Motivation
              Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are an integral tool for studying the architecture of complex genotype and phenotype relationships. Linear mixed models (LMMs) are commonly used to detect associations between genetic markers and a trait of interest, while at the same time allowing to account for population structure and cryptic relatedness. Assumptions of LMMs include a normal distribution of the residuals and that the genetic markers are independent and identically distributed—both assumptions are often violated in real data. Permutation-based methods can help to overcome some of these limitations and provide more realistic thresholds for the discovery of true associations. Still, in practice, they are rarely implemented due to the high computational complexity.
            
            
              Results
              We propose permGWAS, an efficient LMM reformulation based on 4D tensors that can provide permutation-based significance thresholds. We show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art LMMs with respect to runtime and that permutation-based thresholds have lower false discovery rates for skewed phenotypes compared to the commonly used Bonferroni threshold. Furthermore, using permGWAS we re-analyzed more than 500 Arabidopsis thaliana phenotypes with 100 permutations each in less than 8 days on a single GPU. Our re-analyses suggest that applying a permutation-based threshold can improve and refine the interpretation of GWAS results.

            Recent advances in molecular genetic techniques will make dense marker maps available and genotyping many individuals for these markers feasible. Here we attempted to estimate the effects of ∼50,000 marker haplotypes simultaneously from a limited number of phenotypic records. A genome of 1000 cM was simulated with a marker spacing of 1 cM. The markers surrounding every 1-cM region were combined into marker haplotypes. Due to finite population size (Ne = 100), the marker haplotypes were in linkage disequilibrium with the QTL located between the markers. Using least squares, all haplotype effects could not be estimated simultaneously. When only the biggest effects were included, they were overestimated and the accuracy of predicting genetic values of the offspring of the recorded animals was only 0.32. Best linear unbiased prediction of haplotype effects assumed equal variances associated to each 1-cM chromosomal segment, which yielded an accuracy of 0.73, although this assumption was far from true. Bayesian methods that assumed a prior distribution of the variance associated with each chromosome segment increased this accuracy to 0.85, even when the prior was not correct. It was concluded that selection on genetic values predicted from markers could substantially increase the rate of genetic gain in animals and plants, especially if combined with reproductive techniques to shorten the generation interval.},

            The availability of genomewide dense markers brings opportunities and challenges to breeding programs. An important question concerns the ways in which dense markers and pedigrees, together with phenotypic records, should be used to arrive at predictions of genetic values for complex traits. If a large number of markers are included in a regression model, marker-specific shrinkage of regression coefficients may be needed. For this reason, the Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) (BL) appears to be an interesting approach for fitting marker effects in a regression model. This article adapts the BL to arrive at a regression model where markers, pedigrees, and covariates other than markers are considered jointly. Connections between BL and other marker-based regression models are discussed, and the sensitivity of BL with respect to the choice of prior distributions assigned to key parameters is evaluated using simulation. The proposed model was fitted to two data sets from wheat and mouse populations, and evaluated using cross-validation methods. Results indicate that inclusion of markers in the regression further improved the predictive ability of models. An R program that implements the proposed model is freely available.},

            Intraspecific plant diversity can modify the properties of associated arthropod communities and plant fitness. However, it is not well understood which plant traits determine these ecological effects. We explored the effect of intraspecific chemical diversity among neighbouring plants on the associated invertebrate community and plant traits. In a common garden experiment, intraspecific diversity among neighbouring plants was manipulated using three plant populations of wild cabbage that differ in foliar glucosinolates. Plants were larger, harboured more herbivores, but were less damaged when plant diversity was increased. Glucosinolate concentration differentially correlated with generalist and specialist herbivore abundance. Glucosinolate composition correlated with plant damage, while in polycultures, variation in glucosinolate concentrations among neighbouring plants correlated positively with herbivore diversity and negatively with plant damage levels. The results suggest that intraspecific variation in secondary chemistry among neighbouring plants is important in determining the structure of the associated insect community and positively affects plant performance.},

            Arabidopsis  thaliana is an important model organism for understanding the genetics and molecular biology of plants. Its highly selfing nature, small size, short generation time, small genome size, and wide geographic distribution make it an ideal model organism for understanding natural variation. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proven a useful technique for identifying genetic loci responsible for natural variation in A. thaliana. Previously genotyped accessions (natural inbred lines) can be grown in replicate under different conditions and phenotyped for different traits. These important features greatly simplify association mapping of traits and allow for systematic dissection of the genetics of natural variation by the entire A. thaliana community. To facilitate this, we present GWAPP, an interactive Web-based application for conducting GWAS in A. thaliana. Using an efficient implementation of a linear mixed model, traits measured for a subset of 1386 publicly available ecotypes can be uploaded and mapped with a mixed model and other methods in just a couple of minutes. GWAPP features an extensive, interactive, and user-friendly interface that includes interactive Manhattan plots and linkage disequilibrium plots. It also facilitates exploratory data analysis by implementing features such as the inclusion of candidate polymorphisms in the model as cofactors.},

	abstract = {Broad-sense heritability is defined as the proportion of phenotypic variance that is attributable to an overall variance for the genotype. It is often calculated as a measure (i) to quantify and eventually compare the precision of agricultural cultivar trials, and/or (ii) to estimate the response to selection in plant breeding trials. In practice, most such trials are conducted at multiple environments (i.e., year–location combinations) resulting in a multienvironment trial (MET) with unbalanced data, as, for example, not all cultivars are tested at each environment. However, the standard method for estimating heritability implicitly assumes balanced data, independent genotype effects, and homogeneous variances. Therefore, we compared the estimates for broad-sense heritability computed via the standard method to those obtained via six alternative estimation methods (example codes: https://github.com/PaulSchmidtGit/ Heritability). We did so by analyzing four cultivar METs, which all displayed a typically unbalanced data structure but differed in the genetic frameworks of their cultivars. Results indicate that the standard method may overestimate heritability for all datasets, whereas alternative methods show similar estimates per dataset and thus seem better able to handle this kind of unbalanced data. Finally, we show that to compare heritability estimates between different METs, genetic variance component estimates should be fixed to common values for both datasets.},

A valuable additional approach is available through the breeding of crop ideotypes, plants with model characteristics known to influence photosynthesis, growth and (in cereals) grain production. Some instances of the successful use of model characters of this kind are quoted. It is postulated that a successful crop ideotype will be a weak competitor, relative to its mass. Thus the like plants in the crop community will compete with each other to a minimum degree. This relationship of plant form to the exploitation of the enviroment may lead to two negative relationships among genotypes, namely : (a) Between the performance of cultivars at low density and at high density respectively, and (b) Between the competitive ability of cultivars against other genotypes on the one hand, and their capacity for yield in pure culture on the other. A crop ideotype will make a minimum demand on resources per unit of dry matter produced. Further, in cereals, each unit of dry matter will include such a number of florets as to ensure that the ear has sufficient capacity to accept all photosynthates either from its own green surfaces or from other parts of the plant. These criteria are to be satisfied especially at high fertility, and when the total pressure by the community on environmental resources is intensified by high density of population. A wheat ideotype is described. It has a short, strong stem; few, small, erect leaves; a large ear (this specifically means many florets per unit of dry matter of the tops); an erect ear; awns; and a single culm. The design of crop ideotypes is likely to involve concurrent modifications of the environment. The wheat ideotype here described will call for consideration of the density of planting, the fertilizer rate, the plant arrangement and weed control.},

Recent ﬁndings have moved the ﬁeld of plant communication closer to a detailed understanding of how plants emit and perceive VOCs and seem to converge on a model that juxtaposes perception and emission mechanisms. These new mechanistic insights help to explain how plants can integrate different types of information and how environmental noise can affect the transmission of information. At the same time, ever-new functions of VOC-mediated plant–plant interactions are being revealed. Chemical information transfer between plants is now known to fundamentally affect plant organismal interactions and, additionally, population, community, and ecosystem dynamics. One of the most exciting new developments places plant–plant interactions along a behavioral continuum with an eavesdropping strategy at one end and mutually beneﬁcial informationsharing among plants within a population at the other. Most importantly and based on recent ﬁndings as well as theoretical models, plant populations can be predicted to evolve different communication strategies depending on their interaction environment. We use recent studies from ecological model systems to illustrate this context dependency of plant communication. Moreover, we review recent key ﬁndings about the mechanisms and functions of HIPV-mediated information transfer and suggest conceptual links, such as to information theory and behavioral game theory, as valuable tools for a deeper understanding of how plant–plant communication affects ecological and evolutionary dynamics.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Maintaining the past decades current genetic gains for tree species is a challenging task for foresters and tree breeders due to biotic and abiotic factors. Planting a mixture of genotypes or clonal composites can be an alternative to increase the phytosanitary security and yield of forest plantations. These clonal composites are more complex than monocultures due to inter-genotypic competition and indirect genetic effects that can affect the total heritable variation. This study aims to understand how indirect genetic effects can impact the response to selection and how the stand composition can be used to explore these effects and enhance forest yield. We used a clonally trial of
            Eucalyptus urophylla
            ×
            Eucalyptus grandis
            hybrids in a randomized complete block design with 24 replications, containing a single tree per plot evaluated for mean annual increment at 3 and 6 years. We focus on partitioning the genetic variation of trees into direct and indirect genetic effects based on competition intensity factors. We identified clones as aggressive, homeostatic, and sensitive based on the magnitude of indirect genetic effects. By accounting for indirect genetic effects, for mean annual increment, the total heritability decreased 39 and 44\% for 3 and 6 years, respectively. We proposed a workflow that uses the direct and indirect genetic effect to predict the mean value of clonal composite combinations and to select the one with highest yield. Our methodology accounted for spatial variability and interplot competition that can contribute to the total heritable variance and response to selection in forest trials. Based on the models evaluated, the clones are easily classified according to their deviation from the indirect genetic effects mean. Also, we extract useful information to predict different clonal composites compositions, their expected average performance, and define the best recommended combination to be planted in large scale.},

            Bread wheat is a major crop that has long been the focus of basic and breeding research. Assembly of its genome has been difficult because of its large size and allohexaploid nature (AABBDD genome). Following the first reported assembly of the genome of the experimental strain Chinese Spring (CS), the 10+ Wheat Genomes Project was launched to produce multiple assemblies of worldwide modern cultivars. The only Asian cultivar in the project is Norin 61, a representative Japanese cultivar adapted to grow across a broad latitudinal range, mostly characterized by a wet climate and a short growing season. Here, we characterize the key aspects of its chromosome-scale genome assembly spanning 15 Gb with a raw scaffold N50 of 22 Mb. Analysis of the repetitive elements identified chromosomal regions unique to Norin 61 that encompass a tandem array of the pathogenesis-related 13 family. We report novel copy-number variations in the B homeolog of the florigen gene FT1/VRN3, pseudogenization of its D homeolog and the association of its A homeologous alleles with the spring/winter growth habit. Furthermore, the Norin 61 genome carries typical East Asian functional variants different from CS, ranging from a single nucleotide to multi-Mb scale. Examples of such variation are the Fhb1 locus, which confers Fusarium head-blight resistance, Ppd-D1a, which confers early flowering, Glu-D1f for Asian noodle quality and Rht-D1b, which introduced semi-dwarfism during the green revolution. The adoption of Norin 61 as a reference assembly for functional and evolutionary studies will enable comprehensive characterization of the underexploited Asian bread wheat diversity.},

            As sessile, photoautotrophic organisms, plants are subjected to fluctuating sunlight that includes potentially detrimental ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation. Experiments under controlled conditions have shown that the UV-B photoreceptor UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) controls acclimation and tolerance to UV-B in Arabidopsis thaliana; however, its long-term impact on plant fitness under naturally fluctuating environments remain poorly understood. Here, we quantified the survival and reproduction of different Arabidopsis mutant genotypes under diverse field and laboratory conditions. We found that uvr8 mutants produced more fruits than wild type when grown in growth chambers under artificial low-UV-B conditions but not under natural field conditions, indicating a fitness cost in the absence of UV-B stress. Importantly, independent double mutants of UVR8 and the blue light photoreceptor gene CRYPTOCHROME 1 (CRY1) in two genetic backgrounds showed a drastic reduction in fitness in the field. Experiments with UV-B attenuation in the field and with supplemental UV-B in growth chambers demonstrated that UV-B caused the cry1 uvr8 conditional lethal phenotype. Using RNA-seq data of field-grown single and double mutants, we explicitly identified genes showing significant statistical interaction of UVR8 and CRY1 mutations in the presence of UV-B in the field. They were enriched in Gene Ontology categories related to oxidative stress, photoprotection and DNA damage repair in addition to UV-B response. Our study demonstrates the functional importance of the UVR8-mediated response across life stages in natura, which is partially redundant with that of cry1. Moreover, these data provide an integral picture of gene expression associated with plant responses under field conditions.},

            Crop variety mixtures can provide many benefits, including pathogen suppression and increased yield and yield stability. However, these benefits do not necessarily occur in all mixtures, and the benefits of diversity may be compromised by disadvantages due to increased crop heterogeneity. In-field development of mixtures by assembling many combinations of crop genotypes without prior expectation about which genotypes need to be combined to produce well-performing mixtures results in prohibitively large designs. Therefore, effective tools are required to narrow down the number of promising variety mixtures, and to then identify in experiments which of these deliver the highest benefits. Here, we first review current knowledge about the mechanisms underlying effects in ecological diversity experiments and in current agricultural applications. We then discuss some of the principal difficulties arising in the application of this knowledge to develop good variety mixtures. We also discuss non-conventional approaches to solve some of these issues. In particular, we highlight the potential and limitations of trait-based methods to determine good variety mixing partners, and argue that nontraditional traits and trait-derived metrics may be needed for the trait-based approach to deliver its full potential. Specifically, we argue that good mixing partners can be identified using modern genetic and genomic approaches. Alternatively, good mixtures may be obtained by combining varieties that respond differently to environmental variation; such varieties could easily be identified in standard variety testing trials. Preliminary analyses show that niche differences underlying the different environmental responses can indicate functional complementarity and promote mixture yield and yield stability.},

              Most experimental biodiversity–ecosystem functioning research to date has addressed herbaceous plant communities. Comparably little is known about how forest communities will respond to species losses, despite their importance for global biogeochemical cycling. We studied tree species interactions in experimental subtropical tree communities with 33 distinct tree species mixtures and one, two, or four species. Plots were either exposed to natural light levels or shaded. Trees grew rapidly and were intensely competing above ground after 1.5 growing seasons when plots were thinned and the vertical distribution of leaves and wood determined by separating the biomass of harvested trees into 50 cm height increments. Our aim was to analyze effects of species richness in relation to the vertical allocation of leaf biomass and wood, with an emphasis on bipartite competitive interactions among species. Aboveground productivity increased with species richness. The community‐level vertical leaf and wood distribution depended on the species composition of communities. Mean height and breadth of species‐level vertical leaf and wood distributions did not change with species richness. However, the extra biomass produced by mixtures compared to monocultures of the component species increased when vertical leaf distributions of monocultures were more different. Decomposition of biodiversity effects with the additive partitioning scheme indicated positive complementarity effects that were higher in light than in shade. Selection effects did not deviate from zero, irrespective of light levels. Vertical leaf distributions shifted apart in mixed stands as consequence of competition‐driven phenotypic plasticity, promoting realized complementarity. Structural equation models showed that this effect was larger for species that differed more in growth strategies that were characterized by functional traits. In 13 of the 18 investigated two‐species mixtures, both species benefitted relative to intraspecific competition in monoculture. In the remaining five pairwise mixtures, the relative yield gain of one species exceeded the relative yield loss of the other species, resulting in a relative yield total (
              RYT
              ) exceeding 1. Overall, our analysis indicates that richness–productivity relationships are promoted by interspecific niche complementarity at early stages of stand development, and that this effect is enhanced by architectural plasticity.},

                  Plant functional traits can vary widely as a result of phenotypic plasticity to abiotic conditions. Trait variation may also reflect responses to the identity of neighbours, although not all species are equally responsive to their biotic surroundings. We hypothesized that responses to neighbours are shaped by spatial community patterns and resulting variability in neighbour composition. More precisely, we tested the theoretical prediction that plasticity is most likely to evolve if alternative environments (in this case, different neighbour species) are common and encountered at similar frequencies.
                
                
                  We estimated the frequencies of encountering different neighbour species in the field for 27 grassland species and measured the aboveground morphological responses of each species to conspecific vs heterospecific neighbours in a common garden.
                
                
                  
                    Responses to neighbour identity were dependent on how frequently the experimental neighbours were encountered by the focal species in their home community, with the greatest plasticity observed in species that encountered
                    both
                    neighbours (conspecific and heterospecific) with high and even frequency.

              Despite increasing evidence that plant diversity in experimental systems may enhance ecosystem productivity, the mechanisms causing this overyielding remain debated. Here, we review studies of overyielding observed in agricultural intercropping systems, and show that a potentially important mechanism underlying such facilitation is the ability of some crop species to chemically mobilize otherwise‐unavailable forms of one or more limiting soil nutrients such as phosphorus (
              P
              ) and micronutrients (iron (

              e), zinc (

              n) and manganese (
              M
              n)). Phosphorus‐mobilizing crop species improve
              P

              ‐mobilizing species by releasing acid phosphatases, protons and/or carboxylates into the rhizosphere which increases the concentration of soluble inorganic
              P
              in soil. Similarly, on calcareous soils with a very low availability of
              F
              e and
              Z

              n deficiency in neighboring species, by releasing chelating substances. Based on this review, we hypothesize that mobilization‐based facilitative interactions may be an unsuspected, but potentially important mechanism enhancing productivity in both natural ecosystems and biodiversity experiments. We discuss cases in which nutrient mobilization might be occurring in natural ecosystems, and suggest that the nutrient mobilization hypothesis merits formal testing in natural ecosystems.},

              Aims
              Cultivar mixtures can increase productivity through complementarity in resource use, but reported results are often conflicting and the role of plasticity in shaping plant-plant interactions is poorly understood. We aim to determine if individual cultivars show different phenotypic responses when grown in a mixture, whether these responses depend on the neighboring cultivar identity, and how they contribute to variations in productivity and nitrogen (N) use.
            
            
              Methods
              Five spring barley cultivars were field-grown in pure stands and in mixtures during 2 years. Plant traits related to development, growth, N use, and reproduction were measured to identify temporal patterns of plastic responses to neighboring plants.
            
            
              Results
              Plants in mixtures were shorter and developed slower early in the season, but later on they grew faster and produced more grain than the corresponding pure stands. Some cultivars showed complementary N accumulation only when grown together with specific neighbors. Mechanisms of improved productivity differed between the individual mixtures.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Plastic plant-plant interaction between cultivars is an important driver behind the variability in mixing effects. Results contribute to a better understanding of how productivity in cultivar mixtures is affected by plastic adaptation and differentiation of plant traits, depending on the environment created by neighboring genotypes.},

              Arabidopsis
              . Quantitative trait locus analysis of a cross between isogenized accessions revealed that a single locus is responsible for ∼80\% of the variance of the observed difference in root length. This gene, named

              (

	abstract = {Intraspecific variation in plants plays a major role in the composition and diversity of the associated insect community. Resistance traits of plants are likely candidates mediating community composition. However, it is debated whether total concentrations of chemical compounds or specific compounds determine herbivore resistance, and how chemical diversity among plant genotypes in turn affects the composition of the associated herbivore community.
            
              To study the role of specific chemical compounds in affecting the herbivore community, we used cultivated
              Brassica oleracea.
              The cultivars differ qualitatively in glucosinolate profile, i.e., foliar composition of different glucosinolate compounds, and only a little in total concentration of glucosinolates, the secondary metabolites specific for the Brassicaceae family. In field and laboratory experiments, we tested whether individual compounds explained differences in herbivore community composition, and whether herbivores with a similar degree of host plant specialization responded in a similar way to variation in glucosinolate profiles.
            
            
              In the field
              B. oleracea
              cultivars differed widely in species richness and composition of the herbivore community, as well as in the density of insects they harbored. Plants with high concentrations of the short side chain alkenyl glucosinolate, glucoiberin, harbored low herbivore diversity. Higher biodiversity was found when plants had glucosinolate profiles containing high concentrations of glucosinolates with elongated side chains, which are biosynthetically linked to glucoiberin. Although glucosinolates are known to have differential effects on generalist and specialist herbivores, all herbivore species exhibited similar responses to the intraspecific variation in foliar glucosinolate profiles of the
              B. oleracea
              cultivars. This observation is supported by the correspondence between oviposition preferences of the specialist herbivore
              Pieris rapae
              and the generalist
              Mamestra brassicae
              in the field and the laboratory, using the same cultivars, and may be due to the relatively low concentrations of glucosinolates in cultivars. Our results show that variation in the concentration of short side‐chain glucosinolates affects the composition of the herbivore community associated with brassicaceous plants.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            To gain further insight into abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and its role in growth regulation, we have screened for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants hypersensitive to ABA-mediated root growth inhibition. As a result, we have identified a loss-of-function allele of BREVIS RADIX (BRX) in the Columbia background, named brx-2, which shows enhanced response to ABA-mediated inhibition of root growth. BRX encodes a key regulator of cell proliferation and elongation in the root, which has been implicated in the brassinosteroid (BR) pathway as well as in the regulation of auxin-responsive gene expression. Mutants affected in BR signaling that are not impaired in root growth, such as bes1-D, bzr1-D, and bsu1-D, also showed enhanced sensitivity to ABA-mediated inhibition of root growth. Triple loss-of-function mutants affected in PP2Cs, which act as negative regulators of ABA signaling, showed impaired root growth in the absence of exogenous ABA, indicating that disturbed regulation of ABA sensitivity impairs root growth. In agreement with this result, diminishing ABA sensitivity of brx-2 by crossing it with a 35S:HAB1 ABA-insensitive line allowed significantly higher recovery of root growth after brassinolide treatment. Finally, transcriptomic analysis revealed that ABA treatment negatively affects auxin signaling in wild-type and brx-2 roots and that ABA response is globally altered in brx-2. Taken together, our results reveal an interaction between BRs, auxin, and ABA in the control of root growth and indicate that altered sensitivity to ABA is partly responsible for the brx short-root phenotype.},

Here we present estimates of the direct and social genetic variance in growth rate, feed intake, back fat thickness, and muscle depth in a population of 14,032 domestic pigs with known pedigree. Results show that social effects contribute the vast majority of heritable variance in growth rate and feed intake in this population. Total heritable variance expressed relative to phenotypic variance was 71\% for growth rate and 70\% for feed intake. These values clearly exceed the usual range of heritability for those traits. Back fat thickness and muscle depth showed no heritable variance due to social effects. Our results suggest that genetic improvement in agriculture can be substantially advanced by redirecting breeding schemes, so as to capture heritable variance due to social effects.},

              Multiple testing is a challenging issue in genetic association studies using large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, many of which exhibit linkage disequilibrium (LD). Failure to adjust for multiple testing appropriately may produce excessive false positives or overlook true positive signals. The Bonferroni method of adjusting for multiple comparisons is easy to compute, but is well known to be conservative in the presence of LD. On the other hand, permutation‐based corrections can correctly account for LD among SNPs, but are computationally intensive. In this work, we propose a new multiple testing correction method for association studies using SNP markers. We show that it is simple, fast and more accurate than the recently developed methods and is comparable to permutation‐based corrections using both simulated and real data. We also demonstrate how it might be used in whole‐genome association studies to control type I error. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method make it an attractive choice for multiple testing adjustment when there is high intermarker LD in the SNP data set.

The model underlying RABBIT accounts for the joint pattern of recombination breakpoints between two homologous chromosomes and missing data and allelic typing errors in the genotype data of both sampled individuals and founders. Studies on simulated data of the MAGIC and the CC and real data of the MAGIC, the DO, and the CC demonstrate that RABBIT is more robust and accurate in reconstructing recombination bin maps than some commonly used methods.},

              The identity-by-descent (IBD)-based mixed model approach introduced in this study can detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) referring to the parental origin and simultaneously account for multilevel relatedness of individuals within and across families. This unified approach is proved to be a powerful approach for all kinds of multiparental population (MPP) designs.
            
            
              Abstract
              
                Multiparental populations (MPPs) have become popular for quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection. Tools for QTL mapping in MPPs are mostly developed for specific MPPs and do not generalize well to other MPPs. We present an IBD-based mixed model approach for QTL mapping in all kinds of MPP designs, e.g., diallel, Nested Association Mapping (NAM), and Multiparental Advanced Generation Intercross (MAGIC) designs. The first step is to compute identity-by-descent (IBD) probabilities using a general Hidden Markov model framework, called reconstructing ancestry blocks bit by bit (RABBIT). Next, functions of IBD information are used as design matrices, or genetic predictors, in a mixed model approach to estimate variance components for multiallelic genetic effects associated with parents. Family-specific residual genetic effects are added, and a polygenic effect is structured by kinship relations between individuals. Case studies of simulated diallel, NAM, and MAGIC designs proved that the advanced IBD-based multi-QTL mixed model approach incorporating both kinship relations and family-specific residual variances (
                IBD.MQMkin\_F
                ) is robust across a variety of MPP designs and allele segregation patterns in comparison to a widely used benchmark association mapping method, and in most cases, outperformed or behaved at least as well as other tools developed for specific MPP designs in terms of mapping power and resolution. Successful analyses of real data cases confirmed the wide applicability of our IBD-based mixed model methodology.},

              The increasing affordability of sequencing and genotyping technologies has transformed the field of molecular ecology in recent decades. By correlating marker variants with trait variation using association analysis, large‐scale genotyping and phenotyping of individuals from wild populations has enabled the identification of genomic regions that contribute to phenotypic differences among individuals. Such “gene mapping” studies are enabling us to better predict evolutionary potential and the ability of populations to adapt to challenges, such as changing environment. These studies are also allowing us to gain insight into the evolutionary processes maintaining variation in natural populations, to better understand genotype‐by‐environment and epistatic interactions and to track the dynamics of allele frequency change at loci contributing to traits under selection. Gene mapping in the wild using genomewide association scans (
              GWAS
              ) do, however, come with a number of methodological challenges, not least the population structure in space and time inherent to natural populations.

                    accessions grown under controlled conditions. We employed genome‐wide association analysis to investigate the genetic architecture and underlying loci involved in genetic variation in resistance to: two specialist insect herbivores,
                    Pieris rapae
                    and
                    Plutella xylostella

                    P. rapae
                    and infection by the fungal pathogen
                    Botrytis cinerea
                    followed by infestation by

                    We found that genetic variation in resistance to combined stresses by drought plus
                    P. rapae
                    was limited compared with
                    B. cinerea

                    P. rapae
                    alone. Resistance to the two caterpillars is controlled by different genetic components. There is limited overlap in the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying resistance to combined stresses by drought plus

                    or

                    alone. Finally, several candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates and proteinase inhibitors were identified to be involved in resistance to
                    P. rapae
                    and

              Nicotiana attenuata
              . We used intraspecific diversity captured in a 26-parent MAGIC population planted in nature and an updated genome assembly to impute natural variation in the OS-elicited JA-Ile burst linked to a mutation in the JA-Ile biosynthetic gene
              NaJAR4

              NaJAR
              homologues (4 and 6) complementing each other spatially and temporally. From decade-long seed collections of natural populations, we uncovered enzymatically inactive variants occurring at variable frequencies, consistent with a balancing selection regime maintaining variants. Integrative analyses of OS-induced transcriptomes and metabolomes of natural accessions revealed that
              NaJAR4
              is embedded in a nonlinear complex gene coexpression network orchestrating responses to OS, which we tested by silencing four hub genes in two connected coexpressed networks and examining their OS-elicited metabolic responses. Lines silenced in two hub genes (

              NaFB61
              ) had constitutively expressed defenses with high resistance.

            Next‐generation sequencing (NGS) library construction often involves using restriction enzymes to decrease genome complexity, enabling versatile polymorphism detection in plants. However, plant leaves frequently contain impurities, such as polyphenols, necessitating DNA purification before enzymatic reactions. To overcome this problem, we developed a PCR‐based method for expeditious NGS library preparation, offering flexibility in number of detected polymorphisms. By substituting a segment of the simple sequence repeat sequence in the MIG‐seq primer set (MIG‐seq being a PCR method enabling library construction with low‐quality DNA) with degenerate oligonucleotides, we introduced variability in detectable polymorphisms across various crops. This innovation, named degenerate oligonucleotide primer MIG‐seq (dpMIG‐seq), enabled a streamlined protocol for constructing dpMIG‐seq libraries from unpurified DNA, which was implemented stably in several crop species, including fruit trees. Furthermore, dpMIG‐seq facilitated efficient lineage selection in wheat and enabled linkage map construction and quantitative trait loci analysis in tomato, rice, and soybean without necessitating DNA concentration adjustments. These findings underscore the potential of the dpMIG‐seq protocol for advancing genetic analyses across diverse plant species.

            Significance Statement
            Given that plants contain impurities in their leaves, DNA purification is required to construct NGS libraries with reduced genomic complexity using restriction enzymes, which poses a hinderance to rapid genotyping.

            Secondary metabolites are major constituents of plant defense against herbivore attack. Relatively little is known about the cell type–specific formation and antiherbivore activities of secondary compounds in roots despite the substantial impact of root herbivory on plant performance and fitness. Here, we describe the constitutive formation of semivolatile diterpenes called rhizathalenes by the class I terpene synthase (TPS) 08 in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana. The primary enzymatic product of TPS08, rhizathalene A, which is produced from the substrate all-trans geranylgeranyl diphosphate, represents a so far unidentified class of tricyclic diterpene carbon skeletons with an unusual tricyclic spiro-hydrindane structure. Protein targeting and administration of stable isotope precursors indicate that rhizathalenes are biosynthesized in root leucoplasts. TPS08 expression is largely localized to the root stele, suggesting a centric and gradual release of its diterpene products into the peripheral root cell layers. We demonstrate that roots of Arabidopsis tps08 mutant plants, grown aeroponically and in potting substrate, are more susceptible to herbivory by the opportunistic root herbivore fungus gnat (Bradysia spp) and suffer substantial removal of peripheral tissue at larval feeding sites. Our work provides evidence for the in vivo role of semivolatile diterpene metabolites as local antifeedants in belowground direct defense against root-feeding insects.},

Using the hormone-like function of volatile terpenoids in reproductive organ development as a system with a visual marker for communication, we demonstrate that a petunia karrikin-insensitive receptor, PhKAI2ia, stereospecifically perceives the (−)-germacrene D signal, triggering a KAI2-mediated signaling cascade and affecting plant fitness. This study uncovers the role(s) of the intermediate clade of KAI2 receptors, illuminates the involvement of a KAI2ia-dependent signaling pathway in volatile communication, and provides new insights into plant olfaction and the long-standing question about the nature of potential endogenous KAI2 ligand(s).

            Editor’s summary
            
              Organic agricultural practices are designed to have fewer negative local environmental impacts than intensive agriculture by, for example, using less-harmful pesticides. However, less is known about the effects of organic fields on surrounding farms and thus the net impact of organic agriculture. Organic fields may harbor larger pest populations or, alternately, organisms that naturally control pests, leading to potential spillover of organisms to neighboring fields. Using pesticide application data from Kern County, California, Larsen
              et al
              . found that organic fields surrounded by more organic agriculture used pesticides less, whereas conventional fields surrounded by organic agriculture used them more (see the Perspective by Lichtenberg). Clustering organic fields could reduce pesticide use on both organic and conventional fields. —Bianca Lopez

              INTRODUCTION
              Reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture while maintaining or improving yields is a major challenge of the coming decades. Organic agriculture is often suggested as a means to improve agricultural sustainability through more natural production methods, particularly in regards to pesticides and pest control. However, the environmental impacts of organic production practices are only partially understood and it remains unknown whether such production practices have spillover impacts, beneficial or not, for surrounding producers.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              Organic crop production includes a suite of on-farm practices that differ from conventional management techniques. These practices include using different pest management approaches, which may result in the spillover of agricultural pests and/or their natural enemies to nearby agricultural fields resulting in higher or lower pest damage and pesticide use. Here we seek to identify the direct and spillover effects of surrounding organic cropland on pesticide use on both organic and conventional crop fields. To do so, we used field-level pesticide use and crop data for {\textasciitilde}14,000 fields over seven years in Kern County, California, alongside US-wide data on organic agriculture and pesticide use.
            
            
              RESULTS
              We find that the presence of surrounding organic cropland generally leads to a decrease in pesticide use on organic fields, which appears mostly driven by a reduction in insecticides. By contrast, surrounding organic agriculture leads to a small but significant increase in pesticide use on conventional fields. Based on these results, we simulate how changing the proportion of organic cropland changes net insecticide use. While net insecticide use decreases at high levels of organic cropland, at commonly observed levels net insecticide use increases due to the positive (insecticide increasing) effects of surrounding organic cropland on conventional fields. This effect can be entirely mitigated by clustering organic cropland. A coarser, national-scale analysis further evidences the inverted U-shape relationship between organic cropland area and net insecticide use.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              These results suggest that efforts to increase organic cropland could lead to a decrease in pesticide use, but that is more likely at higher levels of organic cropland in the landscape. At low levels of organic cropland, the opposite is expected. Spatially clustering organic fields and spatially separating organic and conventional fields could reduce the environmental footprint of both organic and conventional croplands.
              
                
                  Increases in surrounding organic cropland leads to a rise in pesticide use on conventional fields and a decrease on organic fields.
                  We hypothesize this is due to a spillover of both pests and natural enemies from organic fields, with conventional focal fields increasing and organic focal fields decreasing pesticide use due to different reliance on and abundance of natural enemies of agricultural pests.

              We present the “sumLINK” statistic—the sum of multipoint LOD scores for the subset of pedigrees with nominally significant linkage evidence at a given locus—as an alternative to common methods to identify susceptibility loci in the presence of heterogeneity. We also suggest the “sumLOD” statistic (the sum of positive multipoint LOD scores) as a companion to the sumLINK. sumLINK analysis identifies genetic regions of extreme consistency across pedigrees without regard to negative evidence from unlinked or uninformative pedigrees. Significance is determined by an innovative permutation procedure based on genome shuffling that randomizes linkage information across pedigrees. This procedure for generating the empirical null distribution may be useful for other linkage‐based statistics as well. Using 500 genome‐wide analyses of simulated null data, we show that the genome shuffling procedure results in the correct type 1 error rates for both the sumLINK and sumLOD. The power of the statistics was tested using 100 sets of simulated genome‐wide data from the alternative hypothesis from GAW13. Finally, we illustrate the statistics in an analysis of 190 aggressive prostate cancer pedigrees from the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics, where we identified a new susceptibility locus. We propose that the sumLINK and sumLOD are ideal for collaborative projects and meta‐analyses, as they do not require any sharing of identifiable data between contributing institutions. Further, loci identified with the sumLINK have good potential for gene localization via statistical recombinant mapping, as, by definition, several linked pedigrees contribute to each peak.

              Background
              Mixed linear models (MLM) have been widely used to account for population structure in case-control genome-wide association studies, the status being analyzed as a quantitative phenotype. Chen et al. proved in 2016 that this method is inappropriate in some situations and proposed GMMAT, a score test for the mixed logistic regression (MLR). However, this test does not produces an estimation of the variants’ effects. We propose two computationally efficient methods to estimate the variants’ effects. Their properties and those of other methods (MLM, logistic regression) are evaluated using both simulated and real genomic data from a recent GWAS in two geographically close population in West Africa.
            
            
              Results
              
                We show that, when the disease prevalence differs between population strata, MLM is inappropriate to analyze binary traits. MLR performs the best in all circumstances. The variants’ effects are well evaluated by our methods, with a moderate bias when the effect sizes are large. Additionally, we propose a stratified QQ-plot, enhancing the diagnosis of
                p
                values inflation or deflation when population strata are not clearly identified in the sample.

            Host genetics has recently been shown to be a driver of plant microbiome composition. However, identifying the underlying genetic loci controlling microbial selection remains challenging. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) represent a potentially powerful, unbiased method to identify microbes sensitive to the host genotype and to connect them with the genetic loci that influence their colonization. Here, we conducted a population-level microbiome analysis of the rhizospheres of 200 sorghum genotypes. Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we identify rhizosphere-associated bacteria exhibiting heritable associations with plant genotype, and identify significant overlap between these lineages and heritable taxa recently identified in maize. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GWAS can identify host loci that correlate with the abundance of specific subsets of the rhizosphere microbiome. Finally, we demonstrate that these results can be used to predict rhizosphere microbiome structure for an independent panel of sorghum genotypes based solely on knowledge of host genotypic information.},

              Motivation
              Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are an integral tool for studying the architecture of complex genotype and phenotype relationships. Linear mixed models (LMMs) are commonly used to detect associations between genetic markers and a trait of interest, while at the same time allowing to account for population structure and cryptic relatedness. Assumptions of LMMs include a normal distribution of the residuals and that the genetic markers are independent and identically distributed—both assumptions are often violated in real data. Permutation-based methods can help to overcome some of these limitations and provide more realistic thresholds for the discovery of true associations. Still, in practice, they are rarely implemented due to the high computational complexity.
            
            
              Results
              We propose permGWAS, an efficient LMM reformulation based on 4D tensors that can provide permutation-based significance thresholds. We show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art LMMs with respect to runtime and that permutation-based thresholds have lower false discovery rates for skewed phenotypes compared to the commonly used Bonferroni threshold. Furthermore, using permGWAS we re-analyzed more than 500 Arabidopsis thaliana phenotypes with 100 permutations each in less than 8 days on a single GPU. Our re-analyses suggest that applying a permutation-based threshold can improve and refine the interpretation of GWAS results.
            
            
              Availability and implementation
              permGWAS is open-source and publicly available on GitHub for download: https://github.com/grimmlab/permGWAS.

In addition, host genetic effects on microbial communities vary widely depending on the environment, obscuring conclusions about which microbes are impacted and which plant functions are important. We characterized the leaf microbiota of 200
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              genotypes in eight field experiments and detected consistent host effects on specific, broadly distributed microbial species (operational taxonomic unit [OTUs]). Host genetic effects disproportionately influenced central ecological hubs, with heritability of particular OTUs declining with their distance from the nearest hub within the microbial network. These host effects could reflect either OTUs preferentially associating with specific genotypes or differential microbial success within them. Host genetics associated with microbial hubs explained over 10\% of the variation in lifetime seed production among host genotypes across sites and years. We successfully cultured one of these microbial hubs and demonstrated its growth-promoting effects on plants in sterile conditions. Finally, genome-wide association mapping identified many putatively causal genes with small effects on the relative abundance of microbial hubs across sites and years, and these genes were enriched for those involved in the synthesis of specialized metabolites, auxins, and the immune system. Using untargeted metabolomics, we corroborate the consistent association between variation in specialized metabolites and microbial hubs across field sites. Together, our results reveal that host genetic variation impacts the microbial communities in consistent ways across environments and that these effects contribute to fitness variation among host genotypes.},

Although external and stochastic factors clearly contribute to the individuality of the microbiota, the fundamental principles dictating how environmental factors and host genetic factors combine to shape this complex ecosystem are largely unknown and require systematic study. Here we examined factors that affect microbiota composition in a large (
              n
              = 645) mouse advanced intercross line originating from a cross between C57BL/6J and an ICR-derived outbred line (HR). Quantitative pyrosequencing of the microbiota defined a core measurable microbiota (CMM) of 64 conserved taxonomic groups that varied quantitatively across most animals in the population. Although some of this variation can be explained by litter and cohort effects, individual host genotype had a measurable contribution. Testing of the CMM abundances for cosegregation with 530 fully informative SNP markers identified 18 host quantitative trait loci (QTL) that show significant or suggestive genome-wide linkage with relative abundances of specific microbial taxa. These QTL affect microbiota composition in three ways; some loci control individual microbial species, some control groups of related taxa, and some have putative pleiotropic effects on groups of distantly related organisms. These data provide clear evidence for the importance of host genetic control in shaping individual microbiome diversity in mammals, a key step toward understanding the factors that govern the assemblages of gut microbiota associated with complex diseases.},

We show that association genetics of resistance to diseases such as downy mildew enables increased mapping resolution from quantitative trait loci interval to candidate gene level.

However, there is no concrete foundation as to why 1 is added rather than other constants, such as 0.5 or 2, although the result of ANOVA is much inﬂuenced by the added constant. In this paper, I suggest that 0.5 is preferable to 1 as an added constant, because a discrete distribution deﬁned in \{0, 1, 2, . . .\} is approximately described by a corresponding continuous distribution deﬁned in (0, ϱ) if we add 0.5.

                Plants have evolved a complicated resistance system and exhibit a variety of defense patterns in response to different attackers. Previous studies have shown that responses of plants to chewing insects and phloem-feeding insects are significantly different. Less is known, however, regarding molecular responses to leafminer insects. To investigate plant transcriptome response to leafminers, we selected the leafminer
                Liriomyza huidobrensis
                , which has a special feeding pattern more similar to pathogen damage than that of chewing insects, as a model insect, and
                Arabidopsis thaliana
                as a response plant.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                We first investigated local and systemic responses of
                A. thaliana
                to leafminer feeding using an Affymetrix ATH1 genome array. Genes related to metabolic processes and stimulus responses were highly regulated. Most systemically-induced genes formed a subset of the local response genes. We then downloaded gene expression data from online databases and used hierarchical clustering to explore relationships among gene expression patterns in
                A. thaliana
                damaged by different attackers.

              The pea leafminer,
              Liriomyza huidobrensis
              , is an important pest species affecting ornamental crops worldwide. Plant damage consists of oviposition and feeding punctures created by female adult flies as well as larva‐bored mines in leaf mesophyll tissues. How plants indirectly defend themselves from these two types of leafminer damage has not been sufficiently investigated. In this study, we compared the indirect defense responses of bean plants infested by either female adults or larvae. Puncturing of leaves by adults released green leaf volatiles and terpenoids, while larval feeding caused plants to additionally emit methyl salicylate and (
              E,E
              )‐4,8,12‐trimethyl‐1,3,7,11‐tridecatetraene (TMTT). Puncturing of plants by female adults induced increases in jasmonic acid (JA) and JA‐related gene expressions but reduced the expressions of salicylic acid (SA)‐related genes. In contrast, JA and SA and their‐related gene expression levels were increased significantly by larval feeding. The exogenous application of JA+SA significantly triggered TMTT emission, thereby significantly inducing the orientation behavior of parasitoids. Our study has confirmed that larval feeding can trigger TMTT emission through the activation of both JA and SA pathways to attract parasitoids; however, TMTT alone is less attractive than the complete blend of volatiles released by infested plants.},

            Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has improved our understanding of complex traits, but challenges exist in distinguishing causation versus association caused by linkage disequilibrium. Instead, transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) detect direct associations between expression levels and phenotypic variations, providing an opportunity to better prioritize candidate genes. To assess the feasibility of TWAS, we investigated the association between transcriptomes, genomes, and various traits in Arabidopsis, including flowering time. The associated genes formerly known to regulate growth allometry or metabolite production were first identified by TWAS. Next, for flowering time, six TWAS-newly identified genes were functionally validated. Analysis of the expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) further revealed a trans-regulatory hotspot affecting the expression of several TWAS-identified genes. The hotspot covers the FRIGIDA (FRI) gene body, which possesses multiple haplotypes differentially affecting the expression of downstream genes, such as FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1 (SOC1). We also revealed multiple independent paths towards the loss of function of FRI in natural accessions. Altogether, this study demonstrates the potential of combining TWAS with eQTL analysis to identify important regulatory modules of FRI-FLC-SOC1 for quantitative traits in natural populations.},

              Oxalis corniculata
              , which has intraspecific polymorphism in leaf color (green and red) and examined whether the leaf color variation is associated with urban heat stress. Field observations revealed that green-leaved plants were dominant in green habitats, and red-leaved individuals were dominant in urban habitats, at local ({\textless}500 meters), landscape ({\textless}50 kilometers), and global scales. Growth and photosynthesis experiments demonstrated that red-leaved individuals performed better under heat stress, while green-leaved individuals performed better under nonstressful conditions. Genome-wide SNP analysis suggests that the red leaf may have evolved multiple times from the ancestral green leaf. Overall, the results suggest that the red leaves of

While the impact of climate change on body size has received increasing attention, the long‐term consequences of landscape fragmentation are still poorly known. These two major global threats may potentially induce opposite trends: the decrease of body size in warmer environments (e.g. individuals developing faster) or the selection of larger individuals in fragmented habitats (e.g. large individuals more capable of reaching distant patches).
            We assessed the relationship between temperature and landscape fragmentation with mean body size during the last century, within four European regions (Austria, Belgium, England and above the Arctic circle in Scandinavia) and among queens of five bumblebee species. At the regional scale, we first analysed the variation over time of body size and the two hypothesised drivers, temperature and landscape fragmentation. Then, at the local landscape scale, we tested whether body size varied according to these drivers irrespective of the region. At the regional level, we observed a statistically clear increase of queen body size corresponding to an increase of landscape fragmentation (i.e. in Belgium and England). There was no increase of size when fragmentation did not increase (i.e. in Austria and above the Arctic Circle). Temperature also increased through time in all regions. At the local landscape scale, we found that all species were impacted by changes in both climate and landscape fragmentation but show different trends. The body size of the two largest species significantly increased at landscape level with higher fragmentation while body size of the two smallest species decreased with higher fragmentation. We highlight that, in a context of global changes, landscape fragmentation can also be a major driver of body size clines. Depending on the dispersal abilities of species, larger species could be positively selected for and overcome landscape fragmentation.},

            Plants use photoreceptor proteins to detect the proximity of other plants and to activate adaptive responses. Of these photoreceptors, phytochrome B (phyB), which is sensitive to changes in the red (R) to far‐red (FR) ratio of sunlight, is the one that has been studied in greatest detail. The molecular connections between the proximity signal (low R:FR) and a model physiological response (increased elongation growth) have now been mapped in considerable detail in Arabidopsis seedlings. We briefly review our current understanding of these connections and discuss recent progress in establishing the roles of other photoreceptors in regulating growth‐related pathways in response to competition cues. We also consider processes other than elongation that are controlled by photoreceptors and contribute to plant fitness under variable light conditions, including photoresponses that optimize the utilization of soil resources. In examining recent advances in the field, we highlight emerging roles of phyB as a major modulator of hormones related to plant immunity, in particular salicylic acid and jasmonic acid (JA). Recent attempts to manipulate connections between light signals and defence in Arabidopsis suggest that it might be possible to improve crop health at high planting densities by targeting links between phyB and JA signalling.
          , 
            During the last four decades, there has been an enormous increase in our understanding of how plants sense shading and the proximity of neighbours and how they activate adaptive morphological and physiological responses. Important elements of the signal transduction pathways that connect informational photoreceptors with functional responses have been elucidated, and shade avoidance has become a textbook example of adaptive plasticity. It is now becoming clear that proximity perception leads to a complete reconfiguration of plant function. This reconfiguration allows the plant to optimize the deployment of leaves into light gaps, balance resource allocation between shoots and roots, optimize leaf gas exchange and nutrient uptake as a function of the degree of shading and adaptively regulate interactions with herbivores, pathogens and beneficial microorganisms. In this review, we describe the progress in understanding shade‐avoidance mechanisms and highlight the diversity of plant processes and functions that are controlled by canopy light signals.},

              1.
              While the relationship between facilitation and competition has been explored extensively in recent years, there is also a natural link between facilitation and mutualism, as both are interspecific interactions that confer benefits. Yet, the relationship between these two interactions has been minimally explored.
            
            
              2.
              Here, I explore parallels and differences between mutualism and facilitation. Five focal areas organize current research on mutualism evolution: trait evolution; the continuum from specialization to generalization; the evolutionary origins and maintenance of the interaction; co‐evolution of partners; and the prevalence and implications of cheating. These foci are also helpful for investigating how facilitation evolves, a much less explored issue.
            
            
              3.
              Testable hypotheses regarding the evolution of facilitation include the following: selection should be stronger on traits of facilitated species than on traits of facilitators; facilitative interactions with mutualistic (++) and commensal (+0) outcomes should exhibit greater evolutionary stability than those with antagonistic (+−) outcomes; co‐evolution should be possible in mutualistic and antagonistic facilitation only; when co‐evolution occurs, it should produce a geographic mosaic of interaction outcomes; and antagonistic facilitation could lead to selection on facilitators to either escape or to tolerate the neighbours that benefit from them.
            
            
              4.
              Synthesis
              . Three gaps in our knowledge currently impede progress on evolutionary questions surrounding facilitation. First, reciprocal effects are rarely investigated; facilitation might evolve like mutualism, commensalism or antagonism, depending on effects on the facilitator species. Secondly, the genetics of relevant traits are not yet well explored; the traits themselves are better known for facilitator species than for the facilitated, which are more likely to evolve in the context of the interaction. Finally, the fitness costs and benefits associated with facilitation have rarely been measured. Filling these gaps should permit rapid progress in understanding how facilitation arises, persists and evolves.},

	abstract = {Intercropping is both a well-established and yet novel agricultural practice, depending on one’s perspective. Such perspectives are principally governed by geographic location and whether monocultural practices predominate. Given the negative environmental effects of monoculture agriculture (loss of biodiversity, reliance on non-renewable inputs, soil degradation, etc.), there has been a renewed interest in cropping systems that can reduce the impact of modern agriculture while maintaining (or even increasing) yields. Intercropping is one of the most promising practices in this regard, yet faces a multitude of challenges if it is to compete with and ultimately replace the prevailing monocultural norm. These challenges include the necessity for more complex agricultural designs in space and time, bespoke machinery, and adapted crop cultivars. Plant breeding for monocultures has focused on maximizing yield in single-species stands, leading to highly productive yet specialized genotypes. However, indications suggest that these genotypes are not the best adapted to intercropping systems. Re-designing breeding programs to accommodate inter-specific interactions and compatibilities, with potentially multiple different intercropping partners, is certainly challenging, but recent technological advances offer novel solutions. We identify a number of such technology-driven directions, either ideotype-driven (i.e., “trait-based” breeding) or quantitative genetics-driven (i.e., “product-based” breeding). For ideotype breeding, plant growth modeling can help predict plant traits that affect both inter- and intraspecific interactions and their influence on crop performance. Quantitative breeding approaches, on the other hand, estimate breeding values of component crops without necessarily understanding the underlying mechanisms. We argue that a combined approach, for example, integrating plant growth modeling with genomic-assisted selection and indirect genetic effects, may offer the best chance to bridge the gap between current monoculture breeding programs and the more integrated and diverse breeding programs of the future.},

	abstract = {Summary
            Natural systems are being subjected to unprecedented rates of change and unique pressures from a combination of anthropogenic environmental change drivers. Plant–plant interactions are an important part of the mechanisms governing the response of plant species and communities to these drivers. For example, competition plays a central role in mediating the impacts of atmospheric nitrogen deposition, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, climate change and invasive nonnative species. Other plant–plant interaction processes are also being recognized as important factors in determining the impacts of environmental change, including facilitation and evolutionary processes associated with plant–plant interactions. However, plant–plant interactions are not the only factors determining the response of species and communities to environmental change drivers – their activity must be placed within the context of the wide range of factors that regulate species, communities and ecosystems. A major research challenge is to understand when plant–plant interactions play a key role in regulating the impact of environmental change drivers, and the type of role that plant–plant interactions play. Although this is a considerable challenge, some areas of current research may provide the starting point to achieving these goals, and should be pursued through large‐scale, integrated, multisite experiments.

	abstract = {Plant trait diversity is known to influence population yield, but the scale at which this happens remains unknown: divergent individuals might change yields of immediate neighbors (neighbor scale) or of plants across a population (population scale). We use Nicotiana attenuata plants silenced in mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (irMPK4) – with low water-use efficiency (WUE) – to study the scale at which water-use traits alter intraspecific population yields. In the field and glasshouse, we observed overyielding in populations with low percentages of irMPK4 plants, unrelated to water-use phenotypes. Paired-plant experiments excluded the occurrence of overyielding effects at the neighbor scale. Experimentally altering field arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal associations by silencing the Sym-pathway gene NaCCaMK did not affect reproductive overyielding, implicating an effect independent of belowground AMF interactions. Additionally, micro-grafting experiments revealed dependence on shoot-expressed MPK4 for N. attenuata to vary its yield per neighbor presence. We find that variation in a single gene, MPK4, is responsible for population overyielding through a mechanism, independent of irMPK4’s WUE phenotype, at the aboveground, population scale.
          , 
            Whether on farmland or in a forest, plants do not grow in isolation. Plants compete with their neighbors over limited space and resources, and individual plants respond to this competition in different ways by changing how much they grow and how they use resources. The efficiency with which crop plants use water, for example, is one trait that is dramatically influenced by neighboring plants and is of increasing concern given the warming climate.
            Understanding the effects of interactions between individual plants in a population as a whole is complicated, especially in natural plant communities where neighbors are often from different species. For this reason, McGale et al. took a different approach and looked at neighbors that were all from the same species and differed only in the activity of a single gene. The species in question was coyote tobacco, a plant that is native to western North America.
            McGale et al. used genetic engineering to silence a gene called MPK4, which was known from previous studies to have the effect of reducing water-use efficiency. Some of these ‘water-inefficient’ plants were then grown in mixed populations with plants that had normal levels of MPK4. In experiments conducted both in a glasshouse and at a field station in the Utah desert, McGale et al. found that populations with a low percentage of the MPK4-silenced plants were actually more productive than ‘monocultures’ that were all one type or the other.
            Further analysis showed that the increase in productivity did not depend on the different soil nutrient or water use of the different populations, or even the density of the plants in the populations. Pairs of plants grown in single pots essentially ruled out any interactions between immediate neighbors being responsible for the increased productivity, suggesting that that effect must instead emerge at the level of the population.
            Perhaps unexpectedly, McGale et al. also found that the MPK4-silenced plants and control plants did not actually differ in how they used water when grown in the field (previous studies had all been conducted in glasshouses), indicating that this trait also could not explain the observed population-level effect. Finally, experiments that involved grafting the shoots of one plant onto the roots of another suggested that the effect most likely comes from the aboveground parts of the plant.
            Ecologists have previously noted that more diverse populations typically have higher productivity. This new finding that a small percentage of slightly different plants in an otherwise uniform population can increase overall productivity will likely to be of special interest to researchers looking to boost the efficiency of agricultural ecosystems. Also, since MPK4 is highly conserved, and thus likely to be found in many plant species, this could be an interesting trait with which to study the interactions of natural plant communities.},

                  Agroecosystem diversification through increased crop genetic diversity could provide multiple services such as improved disease control or increased productivity. However, we still poorly understand how genetic diversity affects agronomic performance.
                
                
                  
                    We grew 179 inbred lines of durum wheat in pure stands and in 202 binary mixtures in field conditions. We then tested the effect of allelic richness between genotypes and genotype richness on grain yield and
                    Septoria tritici
                    blotch disease. Allelic richness was tested at 19K single nucleotide polymorphisms distributed along the durum wheat genome. Both genotype richness and allelic richness could be equal to 1 or 2.
                  
                
                
                  Mixtures were overall more productive and less diseased than their pure stand components. Yet, we identified one locus at which allelic richness between genotypes was associated with increased disease severity and decreased grain yield. The effect of allelic richness at this locus was stronger than the effect of genotype richness on grain yield (−7.6\% vs +5.7\%).
                
                
                  Our results suggest that positive effects of crop diversity can be reversed by unfavourable allelic associations. This highlights the need to integrate genomic data into crop diversification strategies. More generally, investigating plant–plant interactions at the genomic level is promising to better understand biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships.},

              identified a gene in teosinte, the wild ancestor of maize, and used it to alter maize such that the plant has a narrower architecture that nonetheless allows leaves access to sunlight (see the Perspective by Hake and Richardson).

              Although the importance of group selection in nature is highly controversial, several researchers have argued that plant breeding for agriculture should be based on group selection, because the goal in agriculture is to optimize population production, not individual fitness. A core hypothesis behind this claim is that crop genotypes with the highest individual fitness in a mixture of genotypes will not produce the highest population yield, because fitness is often increased by “selfish” behaviors, which reduce population performance. We tested this hypothesis by growing 35 cultivars of spring wheat (
              Triticum aestivum
              L.) in mixtures and monocultures, and analyzing the relationship between population yield in monoculture and individual yield in mixture. The relationship was unimodal, as predicted. The highest‐yielding populations were from cultivars that had intermediate fitness, and these produced, on average, 35\% higher yields than cultivars with the highest fitness. It is unlikely that plant breeding or genetic engineering can improve traits that natural selection has been optimizing for millions of years, but there is unutilized potential in traits that increase crop yield by decreasing individual fitness.},

Flowering time is an important life history trait that signifies the switch from vegetative to reproductive growth. The relationship between GY and time from sowing to flowering (Tsf) is unclear. We fit the relationships between GY and RE vs. Tsf to the logistic model using data from 18 spring wheat genotypes grown under simulated rainfed conditions. Tsf accounted for water use before and after flowering, root length density, total leaf area, and the time from flowering to harvest. Early flowering meant decreased water use before flowering and increased water use afterward. Soil water remaining at harvest was positively correlated with yield. Early flowering genotypes have a higher WUE of grain production, but there was no significant difference in the WUE of total biomass production. The relationship between grain yield and Tsf is described as a unimodal curve, as is the relationship between RE and Tsf. Higher yields and a higher RE have been achieved through earlier flowering, and both RE and Tsf reached their optimal values for maximizing GY. Crop breeding is unlikely to achieve further increases in GY through this route in the future. The results suggest that breeding does not improve biomass’s water-use efficiency, but causes changes in biomass allocation strategy, and this could be a new direction for genetically improving grain yield.},

Even though intercropping, compared to average monocultures, is generally more productive, the full yield potential of intercropping might not yet have been achieved as modern crop cultivars are bred to be grown in monoculture. Breeding plants for more familiarity in mixtures, i.e., plants that are adapted to more diverse communities (i.e., adaptation) or even to coexist with each other (i.e., coadaptation) might have the potential to sustainably enhance productivity. In this study, the productivity benefits of familiarity through evolutionary adaptation and coevolutionary coadaptation were disentangled in a crop system through an extensive common garden experiment. Furthermore, evolutionary and coevolutionary effects on species-level and community-level productivity were linked to corresponding changes in functional traits. We found evidence for higher productivity and trait convergence with increasing familiarity with the plant communities. Furthermore, our results provide evidence for the coevolution of plants in mixtures leading to higher productivity of coadapted species. However, with the functional traits measured in our study, we could not fully explain the productivity benefits found upon coevolution. Our study investigated coevolution among randomly interacting plants and was able to demonstrate that coadaptation through coevolution of coexisting species in mixtures occurs and promotes ecosystem functioning (i.e., higher productivity). This result is particularly relevant for the diversification of agricultural and forest ecosystems, demonstrating the added value of artificially selecting plants for the communities they are familiar with.},

            Leaf hairs (trichomes) of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) have been extensively used as a model to address general questions in cell and developmental biology. Here, we lay the foundation for a systems-level understanding of the biology of this model cell type by performing genome-wide gene expression analyses. We have identified 3,231 genes that are up-regulated in mature trichomes relative to leaves without trichomes, and we compared wild-type trichomes with two mutants, glabra3 and triptychon, that affect trichome morphology and physiology in contrasting ways. We found that cell wall-related transcripts were particularly overrepresented in trichomes, consistent with their highly elaborated structure. In addition, trichome expression maps revealed high activities of anthocyanin, flavonoid, and glucosinolate pathways, indicative of the roles of trichomes in the biosynthesis of secondary compounds and defense. Interspecies comparisons revealed that Arabidopsis trichomes share many expressed genes with cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) fibers, making them an attractive model to study industrially important fibers. In addition to identifying physiological processes involved in the development of a specific cell type, we also demonstrated the utility of transcript profiling for identifying and analyzing regulatory gene function. One of the genes that are differentially expressed in fibers is the MYB transcription factor GhMYB25. A combination of transcript profiling and map-based cloning revealed that the NOECK gene of Arabidopsis encodes AtMYB106, a MIXTA-like transcription factor and homolog of cotton GhMYB25. However, in contrast to Antirrhinum, in which MIXTA promotes epidermal cell outgrowth, AtMYB106 appears to function as a repressor of cell outgrowth in Arabidopsis.},

            The class IV homeodomain leucine zipper transcription factor GLABRA2 (GL2) acts in a complex regulatory circuit that regulates the differentiation of trichomes in Arabidopsis thaliana. We describe a genetic interaction with HOMEODOMAIN GLABROUS11 (HDG11), previously identified as a negative regulator of trichome branching. gl2 hdg11 double mutants display enhanced trichome cell-type differentiation defects. Transgenic expression of HDG11 using the GL2 promoter partially suppresses gl2 trichome phenotypes. Vice versa, expression of GL2 under the control of its native promoter partially complements hdg11 ectopic branching. Since gl2 hdg11 and gl2 myb23 double mutants and the triple mutant display similar trichome differentiation defects, we investigated a connection to the R2R3-MYB transcription factor MYB23. We show that MYB23 transcript levels are significantly reduced in shoots from gl2 mutants and that GL2 can drive the expression of a MYB23-promoter fusion to green fluorescent protein. Yeast one-hybrid, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and in planta reporter gene experiments indicate that an L1-box in the MYB23 promoter acts as a GL2 binding site. Taken together, our findings reveal a functional redundancy between GL2 and HDG11, two homeodomain leucine zipper transcription factors previously thought to mediate opposing functions in trichome morphogenesis. A model is proposed in which GL2 transcript levels are maintained through a positive feedback loop involving GL2 activation of MYB23.},

                  Community genetics seeks to understand the mechanisms by which natural genetic variation in heritable host phenotypes can encompass assemblages of organisms such as bacteria, fungi, and many animals including arthropods. Prior studies that focused on plant genotypes have been unable to identify genes controlling community composition, a necessary step to predict ecosystem structure and function as underlying genes shift within plant populations.
                
                
                  
                    We surveyed arthropods within an association population of
                    Populus trichocarpa
                    in three common gardens to discover plant genes that contributed to arthropod community composition. We analyzed our surveys with traditional single‐trait genome‐wide association analysis (GWAS), multitrait GWAS, and functional networks built from a diverse set of plant phenotypes.
                  
                
                
                  Plant genotype was influential in structuring arthropod community composition among several garden sites. Candidate genes important for higher level organization of arthropod communities had broadly applicable functions, such as terpenoid biosynthesis and production of dsRNA binding proteins and protein kinases, which may be capable of targeting multiple arthropod species.
                
                
                  We have demonstrated the ability to detect, in an uncontrolled environment, individual genes that are associated with the community assemblage of arthropods on a host plant, further enhancing our understanding of genetic mechanisms that impact ecosystem structure.},

              Semidwarf accessions occur at low frequency across the distribution range of
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              and are mainly mutants of the

              (
              GA20ox1
              ) gene, mutations of which originate from wild-type alleles still present in the regions where the mutants were found. We identified the causal mutations by allelism tests and sequencing and performed a detailed population genetics analysis of this variation. Using Fay and Wu’s
              H
              statistics, we obtained indications for local selection of the dwarf alleles. Mutants of functional orthologs of this gene have been selected as the so-called “green revolution genes” in rice and barley, thus indicating that
              Arabidopsis
              natural variation can be a source for the identification of useful genes for plant breeding.
            
          , 
            
              Understanding the genetic bases of natural variation for developmental and stress-related traits is a major goal of current plant biology. Variation in plant hormone levels and signaling might underlie such phenotypic variation occurring even within the same species. Here we report the genetic and molecular basis of semidwarf individuals found in natural
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              populations. Allelism tests demonstrate that independent loss-of-function mutations at
              GA locus 5
              (
              GA5
              ), which encodes gibberellin 20-oxidase 1 (
              GA20ox1
              ) involved in the last steps of gibberellin biosynthesis, are found in different populations from southern, western, and northern Europe; central Asia; and Japan. Sequencing of
              GA5
              identified 21 different loss-of-function alleles causing semidwarfness without any obvious general tradeoff affecting plant performance traits.
              GA5
              shows signatures of purifying selection, whereas
              GA5
              loss-of-function alleles can also exhibit patterns of positive selection in specific populations as shown by Fay and Wu’s
              H
              statistics. These results suggest that antagonistic pleiotropy might underlie the occurrence of
              GA5
              loss-of-function mutations in nature. Furthermore, because
              GA5
              is the ortholog of rice

              and barley

              Community ecology aims to understand what factors determine the assembly and dynamics of species assemblages at different spatiotemporal scales. To facilitate the integration between conceptual and statistical approaches in community ecology, we propose Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (
              HMSC
              ) as a general, flexible framework for modern analysis of community data. While non‐manipulative data allow for only correlative and not causal inference, this framework facilitates the formulation of data‐driven hypotheses regarding the processes that structure communities. We model environmental filtering by variation and covariation in the responses of individual species to the characteristics of their environment, with potential contingencies on species traits and phylogenetic relationships. We capture biotic assembly rules by species‐to‐species association matrices, which may be estimated at multiple spatial or temporal scales. We operationalise the
              HMSC
              framework as a hierarchical Bayesian joint species distribution model, and implement it as R‐ and Matlab‐packages which enable computationally efficient analyses of large data sets. Armed with this tool, community ecologists can make sense of many types of data, including spatially explicit data and time‐series data. We illustrate the use of this framework through a series of diverse ecological examples.},

              Pollinators and herbivores can both affect the evolutionary diversification of plant reproductive traits. However, plant defences frequently alter antagonistic and mutualistic interactions, and therefore, variation in plant defences may alter patterns of herbivore‐ and pollinator‐mediated selection on plant traits. We tested this hypothesis by conducting a common garden field experiment using 50 clonal genotypes of white clover (
              Trifolium repens
              ) that varied in a Mendelian‐inherited chemical antiherbivore defence—the production of hydrogen cyanide (HCN). To evaluate whether plant defences alter herbivore‐ and/or pollinator‐mediated selection, we factorially crossed chemical defence (25 cyanogenic and 25 acyanogenic genotypes), herbivore damage (herbivore suppression) and pollination (hand pollination). We found that herbivores weakened selection for increased inflorescence production, suggesting that large displays are costly in the presence of herbivores. In addition, herbivores weakened selection on flower size but only among acyanogenic plants, suggesting that plant defences reduce the strength of herbivore‐mediated selection. Pollinators did not independently affect selection on any trait, although pollinators weakened selection for later flowering among cyanogenic plants. Overall, cyanogenic plant defences consistently increased the strength of positive directional selection on reproductive traits. Herbivores and pollinators both strengthened and weakened the strength of selection on reproductive traits, although herbivores imposed {\textasciitilde}2.7× stronger selection than pollinators across all traits. Contrary to the view that pollinators are the most important agents of selection on reproductive traits, our data show that selection on reproductive traits is driven primarily by variation in herbivory and plant defences in this system.},

            Studies have identified thousands of common genetic variants associated with hundreds of diseases. Yet, these common variants typically account for a minority of the heritability, a problem known as “missing heritability.” Geneticists recently proposed indirect methods for estimating the total heritability attributable to common variants, including those whose effects are too small to allow identification in current studies. Here, we show that these methods seriously underestimate the true heritability when applied to case–control studies of disease. We describe a method that provides unbiased estimates. Applying it to six diseases, we estimate that common variants explain an average of 60\% of the heritability for these diseases. The framework also may be applied to case–control studies, extreme-phenotype studies, and other settings.
          , 
            Genome-wide association studies (GWASs), also called common variant association studies (CVASs), have uncovered thousands of genetic variants associated with hundreds of diseases. However, the variants that reach statistical significance typically explain only a small fraction of the heritability. One explanation for the “missing heritability” is that there are many additional disease-associated common variants whose effects are too small to detect with current sample sizes. It therefore is useful to have methods to quantify the heritability due to common variation, without having to identify all causal variants. Recent studies applied restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation to case–control studies for diseases. Here, we show that REML considerably underestimates the fraction of heritability due to common variation in this setting. The degree of underestimation increases with the rarity of disease, the heritability of the disease, and the size of the sample. Instead, we develop a general framework for heritability estimation, called phenotype correlation–genotype correlation (PCGC) regression, which generalizes the well-known Haseman–Elston regression method. We show that PCGC regression yields unbiased estimates. Applying PCGC regression to six diseases, we estimate the proportion of the phenotypic variance due to common variants to range from 25\% to 56\% and the proportion of heritability due to common variants from 41\% to 68\% (mean 60\%). These results suggest that common variants may explain at least half the heritability for many diseases. PCGC regression also is readily applicable to other settings, including analyzing extreme-phenotype studies and adjusting for covariates such as sex, age, and population structure.},

              Recent advances in single-cell analysis have revealed the stochasticity and nongenetic heterogeneity inherent to cellular processes. However, our knowledge of the actual cellular behaviors in a living multicellular organism is still limited. By using a single-cell bioluminescence imaging technique on duckweed,
              Lemna gibba
              , we demonstrate that, under constant conditions, cells in the intact plant work as individual circadian clocks that oscillate with their own frequencies and respond independently to external stimuli. Quantitative analysis uncovered the heterogeneity and instability of cellular clocks and partial synchronization between neighboring cells. Furthermore, we found that cellular clocks in the plant body under light-dark cycles showed a centrifugal phase pattern in which the effect of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in period lengths was almost masked. The inherent heterogeneity in the properties of cellular clocks observed under constant conditions is corrected under light-dark cycles to coordinate the daily rhythms of the plant body. These findings provide a novel perspective of spatiotemporal architectures in the plant circadian system.},

            Volatile components, such as terpenoids, are emitted from aerial parts of plants and play a major role in the interaction between plants and their environment. Analysis of the composition and emission pattern of volatiles in the model plant Arabidopsis showed that a range of volatile components are released, primarily from flowers. Most of the volatiles detected were monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, which in contrast to other volatiles showed a diurnal emission pattern. The active terpenoid metabolism in wild-type Arabidopsis provoked us to conduct an additional set of experiments in which transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing two different terpene synthases were generated. Leaves of transgenic plants constitutively expressing a dual linalool/nerolidol synthase in the plastids (FaNES1) produced linalool and its glycosylated and hydroxylated derivatives. The sum of glycosylated components was in some of the transgenic lines up to 40- to 60-fold higher than the sum of the corresponding free alcohols. Surprisingly, we also detected the production and emission of nerolidol, albeit at a low level, suggesting that a small pool of its precursor farnesyl diphosphate is present in the plastids. Transgenic lines with strong transgene expression showed growth retardation, possibly as a result of the depletion of isoprenoid precursors in the plastids. In dual-choice assays with Myzus persicae, the FaNES1-expressing lines significantly repelled the aphids. Overexpression of a typical cytosolic sesquiterpene synthase resulted in the production of only trace amounts of the expected sesquiterpene, suggesting tight control of the cytosolic pool of farnesyl diphosphate, the precursor for sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis. This study further demonstrates the value of Arabidopsis for studies of the biosynthesis and ecological role of terpenoids and provides new insights into their metabolism in wild-type and transgenic plants.},

	abstract = {Plants, like many other organisms, have endogenous biological clocks that enable them to organize their physiological, metabolic and developmental processes so that they occur at optimal times. The best studied of these biological clocks are the circadian systems that regulate daily (∼ 24 h) rhythms. At the core of the circadian system in every organism are oscillators responsible for generating circadian rhythms. These oscillators can be entrained (set) by cues from the environment, such as daily changes in light and temperature. Completing the circadian clock model are the output pathways that provide a link between the oscillator and the various biological processes whose rhythms it controls. Over the past few years there has been a tremendous increase in our understanding of the mechanisms of the oscillator and entrainment pathways in plants and many useful reviews on the subject. In this review we focus on the output pathways by which the oscillator regulates rhythmic plant processes. In the first part of the review we describe the role of the circadian system in regulation at all stages of a plant's development, from germination and growth to reproductive development as well as in multiple cellular processes. Indeed, the importance of a circadian clock for plants can be gauged by the fact that so many facets of plant development are under its control. In the second part of the review we describe what is known about the mechanisms by which the circadian system regulates these output processes.},

            Jasmonates (JAs) mediate plant responses to insect attack, wounding, pathogen infection, stress, and UV damage and regulate plant fertility, anthocyanin accumulation, trichome formation, and many other plant developmental processes. Arabidopsis thaliana Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, substrates of the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1)–based SCFCOI1 complex, negatively regulate these plant responses. Little is known about the molecular mechanism for JA regulation of anthocyanin accumulation and trichome initiation. In this study, we revealed that JAZ proteins interact with bHLH (Transparent Testa8, Glabra3 [GL3], and Enhancer of Glabra3 [EGL3]) and R2R3 MYB transcription factors (MYB75 and Glabra1), essential components of WD-repeat/bHLH/MYB transcriptional complexes, to repress JA-regulated anthocyanin accumulation and trichome initiation. Genetic and physiological evidence showed that JA regulates WD-repeat/bHLH/MYB complex-mediated anthocyanin accumulation and trichome initiation in a COI1-dependent manner. Overexpression of the MYB transcription factor MYB75 and bHLH factors (GL3 and EGL3) restored anthocyanin accumulation and trichome initiation in the coi1 mutant, respectively. We speculate that the JA-induced degradation of JAZ proteins abolishes the interactions of JAZ proteins with bHLH and MYB factors, allowing the transcriptional function of WD-repeat/bHLH/MYB complexes, which subsequently activate respective downstream signal cascades to modulate anthocyanin accumulation and trichome initiation.},

              The phytohormones ethylene (ET) and jasmonate (JA) regulate plant development, growth, and defense responses; however, the molecular basis for their signaling crosstalk is unclear. Here, we show that JA‐ZIM‐domain (JAZ) proteins, which repress JA signaling, repress trichome initiation/branching and anthocyanin accumulation, and inhibit the transcriptional activity of the basic helix‐loop‐helix (bHLH)‐MYB members (GLABRA3 (GL3)‐GL1 and TRANSPARENT TESTA 8 (TT8)‐MYB75) of WD‐repeat/bHLH/MYB (WBM) complexes. The ET‐stabilized transcription factors ETHYLENE‐INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) and EIN3‐LIKE1 (EIL1) were found to bind to several members of WBM complexes, including GL3, ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 (EGL3), TT8, GL1, MYB75, and TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1). This binding repressed the transcriptional activity of the bHLH‐MYB proteins and inhibited anthocyanin accumulation, trichome formation, and defenses against insect herbivores while promoting root hair formation. Conversely, the JA‐activated bHLH members GL3, EGL3, and TT8 of WBM complexes were able to interact with and attenuate the transcriptional activity of EIN3/EIL1 at the
              HOOKLESS1
              promoter, and their overexpression inhibited apical hook formation. Thus, this study demonstrates a molecular framework for signaling crosstalk between JA and ET in plant development, secondary metabolism, and defense responses.},

            The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gene BT2 encodes a 41-kD protein that possesses an amino-terminal BTB domain, a central TAZ domain, and a carboxyl-terminal calmodulin-binding domain. We previously demonstrated that BT2 could activate telomerase expression in mature Arabidopsis leaves. Here, we report its distinct role in mediating diverse hormone, stress, and metabolic responses. We serendipitously discovered that steady-state expression of BT2 mRNA was regulated diurnally and controlled by the circadian clock, with maximum expression in the dark. This pattern of expression suggested that BT2 mRNA could be linked to the availability of photosynthate in the plant. Exogenous sugars decreased BT2 expression, whereas exogenous nitrogen increased expression. bt2 loss-of-function mutants displayed a hypersensitive response to both sugar-mediated inhibition of germination and abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated inhibition of germination, thus supporting a role of ABA in sugar signaling in germination and development. Moreover, constitutive expression of BT2 imparted resistance to both sugars and ABA at germination, suggesting that BT2 suppresses sugar and ABA responses. In support of the previously described antagonistic relationship between ABA and auxin, we found that BT2 positively regulated certain auxin responses in plants, as revealed by knocking down BT2 expression in the high-auxin mutant yucca. Accumulation of BT2 mRNA was affected by a variety of hormones, nutrients, and stresses, and BT2 was required for responses to many of these same factors. Together, these results suggest that BT2 is a central component of an interconnected signaling network that detects and responds to multiple inputs.},

            CEPs (C-TERMINALLY ENCODED PEPTIDEs) inhibit Arabidopsis primary root growth by unknown mechanisms. We investigated how CEP3 levels control primary root growth. CEP3 peptide application decreased cell division, S-phase cell number, root meristematic cell number, and meristem zone (MZ) size in a dose- and CEP RECEPTOR1-dependent manner. Grafting showed that CEP3-dependent growth inhibition requires root and shoot CEPR1. CEP3 induced mitotic quiescence in MZ cells significantly faster than that induced by nutrient limitation alone. CEP3 also inhibited the restoration of S-phase to mitotically quiescence cells by nutrient resupply without quantitatively reducing TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) kinase activity. In contrast, cep3-1 had an increased meristem size and S-phase cell number under nitrogen (N)-limited conditions, but not under N-sufficient conditions. Furthermore, cep3-1 meristematic cells remained in S-phase longer than wild-type cells during a sustained carbon (C) and N limitation. RNA sequencing showed that CEP3 peptide down-regulated genes involved in S-phase entry, cell wall and ribosome biogenesis, DNA replication, and meristem expansion, and up-regulated genes involved in catabolic processes and proteins and peptides that negatively control meristem expansion and root growth. Many of these genes were reciprocally regulated in cep3-1. The results suggest that raising CEP3 induces starvation-related responses that curtail primary root growth under severe nutrient limitation.},

              Associations of plants and herbivores are regarded as the result of coevolution, which has produced an astonishing diversity of plant defenses and corresponding insect counteradaptations. We focus on the leaf beetle
              Phyllotreta striolata
              , which is adapted to the glucosinolate-myrosinase system present in its cruciferous host plants. We show that
              P. striolata
              adults not only selectively sequester intact glucosinolates from their host plants but also express their own myrosinase, a member of the β-glucosidase family capable of hydrolyzing glucosinolates to form toxic degradation products. Our results reveal the convergent evolution of a glucosinolate-myrosinase system in
              P. striolata
              that enables this herbivore to use glucosinolate hydrolysis products for its own purposes.
            
          , 
            
              The ability of a specialized herbivore to overcome the chemical defense of a particular plant taxon not only makes it accessible as a food source but may also provide metabolites to be exploited for communication or chemical defense.
              Phyllotreta
              flea beetles are adapted to crucifer plants (Brassicales) that are defended by the glucosinolate-myrosinase system, the so-called “mustard-oil bomb.” Tissue damage caused by insect feeding brings glucosinolates into contact with the plant enzyme myrosinase, which hydrolyzes them to form toxic compounds, such as isothiocyanates. However, we previously observed that
              Phyllotreta striolata
              beetles themselves produce volatile glucosinolate hydrolysis products. Here, we show that
              P. striolata
              adults selectively accumulate glucosinolates from their food plants to up to 1.75\% of their body weight and express their own myrosinase. By combining proteomics and transcriptomics, a gene responsible for myrosinase activity in
              P. striolata
              was identified. The major substrates of the heterologously expressed myrosinase were aliphatic glucosinolates, which were hydrolyzed with at least fourfold higher efficiency than aromatic and indolic glucosinolates, and β-O-glucosides. The identified beetle myrosinase belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family 1 and has up to 76\% sequence similarity to other β-glucosidases. Phylogenetic analyses suggest species-specific diversification of this gene family in insects and an independent evolution of the beetle myrosinase from other insect β-glucosidases.},

            Stomata allow CO2 uptake by leaves for photosynthetic assimilation at the cost of water vapor loss to the atmosphere. The opening and closing of stomata in response to fluctuations in light intensity regulate CO2 and water fluxes and are essential for maintaining water-use efficiency (WUE). However, a little is known about the genetic basis for natural variation in stomatal movement, especially in C4 crops. This is partly because the stomatal response to a change in light intensity is difficult to measure at the scale required for association studies. Here, we used high-throughput thermal imaging to bypass the phenotyping bottleneck and assess 10 traits describing stomatal conductance (gs) before, during and after a stepwise decrease in light intensity for a diversity panel of 659 sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) accessions. Results from thermal imaging significantly correlated with photosynthetic gas exchange measurements. gs traits varied substantially across the population and were moderately heritable (h2 up to 0.72). An integrated genome-wide and transcriptome-wide association study identified candidate genes putatively driving variation in stomatal conductance traits. Of the 239 unique candidate genes identified with the greatest confidence, 77 were putative orthologs of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genes related to functions implicated in WUE, including stomatal opening/closing (24 genes), stomatal/epidermal cell development (35 genes), leaf/vasculature development (12 genes), or chlorophyll metabolism/photosynthesis (8 genes). These findings demonstrate an approach to finding genotype-to-phenotype relationships for a challenging trait as well as candidate genes for further investigation of the genetic basis of WUE in a model C4 grass for bioenergy, food, and forage production.},

            Modern improvement of complex traits in agricultural species relies on successful associations of heritable molecular variation with observable phenotypes. Historically, this pursuit has primarily been based on easily measurable genetic markers. The recent advent of new technologies allows assaying and quantifying biological intermediates (hereafter endophenotypes) which are now readily measurable at a large scale across diverse individuals. The usefulness of endophenotypes for delineating the regulatory landscape of the genome and genetic dissection of complex trait variation remains underexplored in plants. The work presented here illustrated the utility of a large-scale (299-genotype and seven-tissue) gene expression resource to dissect traits across multiple levels of biological organization. Using single-tissue- and multi-tissue-based transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), we revealed that about half of the functional variation acts through altered transcript abundance for maize kernel traits, including 30 grain carotenoid abundance traits, 20 grain tocochromanol abundance traits, and 22 field-measured agronomic traits. Comparing the efficacy of TWAS with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and an ensemble approach that combines both GWAS and TWAS, we demonstrated that results of TWAS in combination with GWAS increase the power to detect known genes and aid in prioritizing likely causal genes. Using a variance partitioning approach in the largely independent maize Nested Association Mapping (NAM) population, we also showed that the most strongly associated genes identified by combining GWAS and TWAS explain more heritable variance for a majority of traits than the heritability captured by the random genes and the genes identified by GWAS or TWAS alone. This not only improves the ability to link genes to phenotypes, but also highlights the phenotypic consequences of regulatory variation in plants.},

            In transcriptome‐wide association studies (TWAS), gene expression values are predicted using genotype data and tested for association with a phenotype. The power of this approach to detect associations relies, at least in part, on the accuracy of the prediction. Here we compare the prediction accuracy of six different methods—LASSO, Ridge regression, Elastic net, Best Linear Unbiased Predictor, Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Model, and Random Forests—by performing cross‐validation using data from the Geuvadis Project. We also examine prediction accuracy (a) at different sample sizes, (b) when ancestry of the prediction model training and testing populations is different, and (c) when the tissue used to train the model is different from the tissue to be predicted. We find that, for most genes, the expression cannot be accurately predicted, but in general sparse statistical models tend to outperform polygenic models at prediction. Average prediction accuracy is reduced when the model training set size is reduced or when predicting across ancestries and is marginally reduced when predicting across tissues. We conclude that using sparse statistical models and the development of large reference panels across multiple ethnicities and tissues will lead to better prediction of gene expression, and thus may improve TWAS power.},

            Plants synthesize specialized metabolites to facilitate environmental and ecological interactions. During evolution, plants diversified in their potential to synthesize these metabolites. Quantitative differences in metabolite levels of natural Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) accessions can be employed to unravel the genetic basis for metabolic traits using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here, we performed metabolic GWAS on seeds of a panel of 315 A. thaliana natural accessions, including the reference genotypes C24 and Col-0, for polar and semi-polar seed metabolites using untargeted ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. As a complementary approach, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of near-isogenic introgression lines between C24 and Col-0 for specific seed specialized metabolites. Besides common QTL between seeds and leaves, GWAS revealed seed-specific QTL for specialized metabolites, indicating differences in the genetic architecture of seeds and leaves. In seeds, aliphatic methylsulfinylalkyl and methylthioalkyl glucosinolates associated with the ALKENYL HYDROXYALKYL PRODUCING loci (GS-ALK and GS-OHP) on chromosome 4 containing alkenyl hydroxyalkyl producing 2 (AOP2) and 3 (AOP3) or with the GS-ELONG locus on chromosome 5 containing methylthioalkyl malate synthase (MAM1) and MAM3. We detected two unknown sulfur-containing compounds that were also mapped to these loci. In GWAS, some of the annotated flavonoids (kaempferol 3-O-rhamnoside-7-O-rhamnoside, quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside-7-O-rhamnoside) were mapped to transparent testa 7 (AT5G07990), encoding a cytochrome P450 75B1 monooxygenase. Three additional mass signals corresponding to quercetin-containing flavonols were mapped to UGT78D2 (AT5G17050). The association of the loci and associating metabolic features were functionally verified in knockdown mutant lines. By performing GWAS and QTL mapping, we were able to leverage variation of natural populations and parental lines to study seed specialized metabolism. The GWAS data set generated here is a high-quality resource that can be investigated in further studies.},

            Secondary metabolites are major constituents of plant defense against herbivore attack. Relatively little is known about the cell type–specific formation and antiherbivore activities of secondary compounds in roots despite the substantial impact of root herbivory on plant performance and fitness. Here, we describe the constitutive formation of semivolatile diterpenes called rhizathalenes by the class I terpene synthase (TPS) 08 in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana. The primary enzymatic product of TPS08, rhizathalene A, which is produced from the substrate all-trans geranylgeranyl diphosphate, represents a so far unidentified class of tricyclic diterpene carbon skeletons with an unusual tricyclic spiro-hydrindane structure. Protein targeting and administration of stable isotope precursors indicate that rhizathalenes are biosynthesized in root leucoplasts. TPS08 expression is largely localized to the root stele, suggesting a centric and gradual release of its diterpene products into the peripheral root cell layers. We demonstrate that roots of Arabidopsis tps08 mutant plants, grown aeroponically and in potting substrate, are more susceptible to herbivory by the opportunistic root herbivore fungus gnat (Bradysia spp) and suffer substantial removal of peripheral tissue at larval feeding sites. Our work provides evidence for the in vivo role of semivolatile diterpene metabolites as local antifeedants in belowground direct defense against root-feeding insects.},

              Aphids are infected by a series of bacteria that can help them survive on specific host plants. However, the associations between aphids and these bacteria are not clear, and the bacterial communities in many aphid species are poorly characterized. Here, we investigated the bacterial communities of cotton aphids (
              Aphis gossypii
              ) on 2 representative winter host plants and transferred to 3 summer host plants by 16S rDNA sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Our results revealed that the bacterial communities varied among cotton aphids on hibiscus, cotton aphids on pomegranate, cotton aphids on cotton transferred from hibiscus, cotton aphids on muskmelon transferred from hibiscus, cotton aphids on cucumber transferred from hibiscus,. The diversity and richness of the bacterial communities were significantly higher in aphids on muskmelon and aphids on cucumber than in the other treatments. There were two main factors influencing the distribution of internal bacterial OTUs revealed by principal component analysis, including the differences among Punicaceae, Malvaceae and Cucurbitaceae. There were 28 bacterial communities with significant differences between two arbitrary treatments, which could be grouped into 6 main clusters depending on relative abundance. Moreover, our results indicated that in addition to the obligate endosymbiont
              Buchnera

                  Urban areas are often considered to be a hostile environment for wildlife as they are highly fragmented and frequently disturbed. However, these same habitats can contain abundant resources, while lacking many common competitors and predators. The urban environment can have a direct impact on the species living there but can also have indirect effects on their parasites and pathogens. To date, relatively few studies have measured how fine‐scale spatial heterogeneity within urban landscapes can affect parasite transmission and persistence.
                
                
                  
                    Here, we surveyed 237 greenspaces across the urban environment of Edinburgh (UK) to investigate how fine‐scale variation in socio‐economic and ecological variables can affect red fox (
                    Vulpes vulpes
                    ) marking behavior, gastrointestinal (GI) parasite prevalence, and parasite community diversity.
                  
                
                
                  We found that the presence and abundance of red fox fecal markings were nonuniformly distributed across greenspaces and instead were dependent on the ecological characteristics of a site. Specifically, common foraging areas were left largely unmarked, which indicates that suitable resting and denning sites may be limiting factor in urban environments. In addition, the amount of greenspace around each site was positively correlated with overall GI parasite prevalence, species richness, and diversity, highlighting the importance of greenspace (a commonly used measure of landscape connectivity) in determining the composition of the parasite community in urban areas.
                
                
                  Our results suggest that fine‐scale variation within urban environments can be important for understanding the ecology of infectious diseases in urban wildlife and could have wider implication for the management of urban carnivores.},

            Little is known about molecular responses in plants to phloem feeding by insects. The induction of genes associated with wound and pathogen response pathways was investigated following green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) feeding on Arabidopsis. Aphid feeding on rosette leaves induced transcription of two genes associated with salicylic acid (SA)-dependent responses to pathogens (PR-1 and BGL2) 10- and 23-fold, respectively. Induction of PR-1 and BGL2mRNA was reduced in npr1 mutant plants, which are deficient in SA signaling. Application of the SA analog benzothiadiazole led to decreases in aphid reproduction on leaves of both wild-type plants and mutant plants deficient in responsiveness to SA, suggesting that wild-type SA-dependent responses do not influence resistance to aphids. Two-fold increases occurred in mRNA levels ofPDF1.2, which encodes defensin, a peptide involved in the jasmonate (JA)-/ethylene-dependent response pathway. Transcripts encoding JA-inducible lipoxygenase (LOX2) and SA/JA-inducible Phe-ammonia lyase increased 1.5- to 2-fold.PDF1.2 and LOX2 induction by aphids did not occur in infested leaves of the JA-resistant coi1-1mutant.

Phytohormonal signaling plays a major role in this network; however, the dynamics of the signal spreading is yet to be clarified. Despite the growing knowledge about transcriptomic changes upon infestation, results often differ due to sampling, varying strongly between the tissues collected at the single feeding site, individual leaves, pooled infested leaves, or whole plant rosettes. This study focuses on activation of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) signals in Arabidopsis leaves during infestation by cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae) in high spatio-temporal resolution. We used genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors, histochemistry, and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR to precisely map activation of distinct branches of phytohormonal signaling. We found a rapid induction of SA and JA signaling markers in cells surrounding stylet puncture, colocalizing with callose deposition. For both PR1 and JAZ10, we detected activation at 24 h postinfestation (hpi), increasing and spreading along the veins until 72 hpi and, to a lesser extent, within the epidermal pavement cells. The SA signaling wave appeared in parallel with JA-associated signaling and continued to increase in time. Our results first show a local activation of SA- and JA-related responses after stylet penetration of Arabidopsis leaves and bring a detailed insight into the spatio-temporal complexity of plant defense activation during specialist aphid attack.

              To ensure their survival in natural habitats, plants must recognize and respond to a wide variety of insect herbivores. Aphids and other Hemiptera pose a particular challenge, because they cause relatively little direct tissue damage when inserting their slender stylets intercellularly to feed from the phloem sieve elements. Plant responses to this unusual feeding strategy almost certainly include recognition of aphid salivary components and the induction of phloem‐specific defenses. Due to the excellent genetic and genomic resources that are available for
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              (Arabidopsis), this plant was chosen as a model system to study the metabolic and transcriptional responses to infestation by two aphids,
              Myzus persicae
              (green peach aphid, a broad generalist) and
              Brevicoryne brassicae
              (cabbage aphid, a crucifer‐feeding specialist). Future research on Arabidopsis–aphid interactions will lead to the identification of aphid‐specific elicitors, components of the defense‐signaling pathway, and additional metabolic responses that are induced by aphid infestation.

            Since 1999, The Arabidopsis Information Resource (www.arabidopsis.org) has been curating data about the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. Its primary focus is integrating experimental gene function information from the peer-reviewed literature and codifying it as controlled vocabulary annotations. Our goal is to produce a “gold standard” functional annotation set that reflects the current state of knowledge about the Arabidopsis genome. At the same time, the resource serves as a nexus for community-based collaborations aimed at improving data quality, access, and reuse. For the past decade, our work has been made possible by subscriptions from our global user base. This update covers our ongoing biocuration work, some of our modernization efforts that contribute to the first major infrastructure overhaul since 2011, the introduction of JBrowse2, and the resource's role in community activities such as organizing the structural reannotation of the genome. For gene function assessment, we used gene ontology annotations as a metric to evaluate: (1) what is currently known about Arabidopsis gene function and (2) the set of “unknown” genes. Currently, 74\% of the proteome has been annotated to at least one gene ontology term. Of those loci, half have experimental support for at least one of the following aspects: molecular function, biological process, or cellular component. Our work sheds light on the genes for which we have not yet identified any published experimental data and have no functional annotation. Drawing attention to these unknown genes highlights knowledge gaps and potential sources of novel discoveries.},

We find predictable “up-and-down” fluctuations in stripe frequency in all populations, representing repeatable evolutionary dynamics based on standing genetic variation. A field experiment demonstrates that these fluctuations involve negative frequency-dependent natural selection (NFDS). These fluctuations rely on demographic and selective variability that pushes populations away from equilibrium, such that they can reliably move back toward it via NFDS. Last, we show that the origin of new cryptic forms is associated with multiple structural genomic variants such that which mutations arise affects evolution at larger temporal scales. Thus, evolution from existing variation is predictable and repeatable, but mutation adds complexity even for traits evolving deterministically under natural selection.

              Intraspecific genetic variation in foundation species such as aspen (
              Populus tremuloides
              Michx.) shapes their impact on forest structure and function. Identifying genes underlying ecologically important traits is key to understanding that impact. Previous studies, using single‐locus genome‐wide association (GWA) analyses to identify candidate genes, have identified fewer genes than anticipated for highly heritable quantitative traits. Mounting evidence suggests that polygenic control of quantitative traits is largely responsible for this “missing heritability” phenomenon. Our research characterized the genetic architecture of 30 ecologically important traits using a common garden of aspen through genomic and transcriptomic analyses. A multilocus association model revealed that most traits displayed a highly polygenic architecture, with most variation explained by loci with small effects (likely below the detection levels of single‐locus GWA methods). Consistent with a polygenic architecture, our single‐locus GWA analyses found only 38 significant SNPs in 22 genes across 15 traits. Next, we used differential expression analysis on a subset of aspen genets with divergent concentrations of salicinoid phenolic glycosides (key defense traits). This complementary method to traditional GWA discovered 1243 differentially expressed genes for a polygenic trait. Soft clustering analysis revealed three gene clusters (241 candidate genes) involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis and regulation. Our work reveals that ecologically important traits governing higher‐order community‐ and ecosystem‐level attributes of a foundation forest tree species have complex underlying genetic structures and will require methods beyond traditional GWA analyses to unravel.},

These methods to estimate quantitative genetic parameters have recently been advocated for use in evolutionary studies of natural populations. Therefore, it is perhaps timely to discuss the development of REML methods and their application to the analysis of artificial selection experiments and breeding programmes in animals.

	abstract = {Some individuals die before a trait is measured or expressed (the invisible fraction), and some relevant traits are not measured in any individual (missing traits). This paper discusses how these concepts can be cast in terms of missing data problems from statistics. Using missing data theory, I show formally the conditions under which a valid evolutionary inference is possible when the invisible fraction and/or missing traits are ignored. These conditions are restrictive and unlikely to be met in even the most comprehensive long-term studies. When these conditions are not met, many selection and quantitative genetic parameters cannot be estimated accurately unless the missing data process is explicitly modelled. Surprisingly, this does not seem to have been attempted in evolutionary biology. In the case of the invisible fraction, viability selection and the missing data process are often intimately linked. In such cases, models used in survival analysis can be extended to provide a flexible and justified model of the missing data mechanism. Although missing traits pose a more difficult problem, important biological parameters can still be estimated without bias when appropriate techniques are used. This is in contrast to current methods which have large biases and poor precision. Generally, the quantitative genetic approach is shown to be superior to phenotypic studies of selection when invisible fractions or missing traits exist because part of the missing information can be recovered from relatives.},

	abstract = {Drought limits crop yields, and with climate change, the severity of water stress is projected to increase in many production environments. Therefore, it has never been more important to deliver the findings of drought research to farmers. The maintenance in situ, collection and characterisation of key genetic variability for stress tolerance, its introgression into agronomically adapted materials, and the subsequent deployment of improved cultivars is a continuum. This paper focuses on one segment of the pathway—the process from genetic characterisation to cultivar delivery—and possible efficiencies are discussed with emphasis on wheat, one of the world’s most important food crops.
The first efficiency is to limit the initial exploitation of genetic resources to close relatives, as much of this variation remains uncharacterised, rather than attempting gene transfers from unrelated species, which is time-consuming and has a low probability of success. Synthetic wheat, developed by crossing modern tetraploid wheat to Aegilops tauschii, the donor of the D-genome, has provided new genetic diversity for stress tolerance and yield advantages under drought in excess of 30\% have been reported. Synthetic wheat can also be made using Triticum dicoccum, often referred to as emmer wheat, thus introducing new variation for all three wheat genomes.
The second efficiency is better coordinated, field-based phenotyping. The Australian Managed Environment Facility and similar national facilities established in India and China provide a basis for accurate field-based phenotyping and the weighting of physiological traits related to water-use efficiency on a national scale. The calculation of a water balance, careful management of site heterogeneity and judicious use of rain shelters maximise trait expression and improve the relevance of results.
The third efficiency is to maximise locally the benefits of global public-good research. The global wheat improvement programs of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) have a mandate to ‘tame’ genetic diversity and distribute these improved materials globally in nurseries targeted to specific environmental conditions such as drought. Nevertheless, the exploitation of these materials is rarely managed well at the national level. The CIMMYT Australia ICARDA Germplasm Evaluation (CAIGE) program is a nationally coordinated germplasm introduction and evaluation program. Key CGIAR nurseries are received and grown by Australian quarantine, increased at one or two locations, tested for disease resistance and subsequently grown nationally in yield trials. The data are stored on the CAIGE website and, along with all supporting data generated by the international centres, are publicly available.},

            The aim of plant breeding trials is often to identify crop variety that are well adapt to target environments. These varieties are identified through genomic prediction from the analysis of multi‐environmental field trial (MET) using linear mixed models. The occurrence of outliers in MET is common and known to adversely impact the accuracy of genomic prediction yet the detection of outliers are often neglected. A number of reasons stand for this—first, complex data such as a MET give rise to distinct levels of residuals (eg, at a trial level or individual observation level). This complexity offers additional challenges for an outlier detection method. Second, many linear mixed model software packages that cater for complex variance structures needed in the analysis of MET are not well streamlined for diagnostics by practitioners. We demonstrate outlier detection methods that are simple to implement in any linear mixed model software packages and computationally fast. Although these methods are not optimal methods in outlier detection, they offer practical value for ease of application in the analysis pipeline of regularly collected data. These are demonstrated using simulation based on two real bread wheat yield METs. In particular, models that consider analysis of yield trials either independently or jointly (thus borrowing strength across trials) are considered. Case studies are presented to highlight benefit of joint analysis for outlier detection.},

            To cope with the challenges facing agriculture, speeding-up breeding programs is a worthy endeavor, especially for perennial species such as grapevine, but requires understanding the genetic architecture of target traits. To go beyond the mapping of quantitative trait loci in bi-parental crosses, we exploited a diversity panel of 279 Vitis vinifera L. cultivars planted in 5 blocks in the vineyard. This panel was phenotyped over several years for 127 traits including yield components, organic acids, aroma precursors, polyphenols, and a water stress indicator. The panel was genotyped for 63k single nucleotide polymorphisms by combining an 18K microarray and genotyping-by-sequencing. The experimental design allowed to reliably assess the genotypic values for most traits. Marker densification via genotyping-by-sequencing markedly increased the proportion of genetic variance explained by single nucleotide polymorphisms, and 2 multi-single nucleotide polymorphism models identified quantitative trait loci not found by a single nucleotide polymorphism-by-single nucleotide polymorphism model. Overall, 489 reliable quantitative trait loci were detected for 41\% more response variables than by a single nucleotide polymorphism-by-single nucleotide polymorphism model with microarray-only single nucleotide polymorphisms, many new ones compared with the results from bi-parental crosses. A prediction accuracy higher than 0.42 was obtained for 50\% of the response variables. Our overall approach as well as quantitative trait locus and prediction results provide insights into the genetic architecture of target traits. New candidate genes and the application into breeding are discussed.},

              Autopolyploidy is more common in plants than traditionally assumed, but has received little attention compared with allopolyploidy. Hence, the advantages and disadvantages of genome doubling
              per se
              compared with genome doubling coupled with hybridizations in allopolyploids remain unclear. Autopolyploids are characterized by genomic redundancy and polysomic inheritance, increasing effective population size. To shed light on the evolutionary consequences of autopolyploidy, we review a broad range of studies focusing on both synthetic and natural autopolyploids encompassing levels of biological organization from genes to evolutionary lineages. The limited evidence currently available suggests that autopolyploids neither experience strong genome restructuring nor wide reorganization of gene expression during the first generations following genome doubling, but that these processes may become more important in the longer term. Biogeographic and ecological surveys point to an association between the formation of autopolyploid lineages and environmental change. We thus hypothesize that polysomic inheritance may provide a short‐term evolutionary advantage for autopolyploids compared to diploid relatives when environmental change enforces range shifts. In addition, autopolyploids should possess increased genome flexibility, allowing them to adapt and persist across heterogeneous landscapes in the long run.},

              Background
              Selection has dramatically shaped genetic and phenotypic variation in bread wheat. We can assess the genomic basis of historical phenotypic changes, and the potential for future improvement, using experimental populations that attempt to undo selection through the randomizing effects of recombination.
            
            
              Results
              We bred the NIAB Diverse MAGIC multi-parent population comprising over 500 recombinant inbred lines, descended from sixteen historical UK bread wheat varieties released between 1935 and 2004. We sequence the founders’ genes and promoters by capture, and the MAGIC population by low-coverage whole-genome sequencing. We impute 1.1 M high-quality SNPs that are over 99\% concordant with array genotypes. Imputation accuracy only marginally improves when including the founders’ genomes as a haplotype reference panel. Despite capturing 73\% of global wheat genetic polymorphism, 83\% of genes cluster into no more than three haplotypes. We phenotype 47 agronomic traits over 2 years and map 136 genome-wide significant associations, concentrated at 42 genetic loci with large and often pleiotropic effects. Around half of these overlap known quantitative trait loci. Most traits exhibit extensive polygenicity, as revealed by multi-locus shrinkage modelling.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our results are consistent with a gene pool of low haplotypic diversity, containing few novel loci of large effect. Most past, and projected future, phenotypic changes arising from existing variation involve fine-scale shuffling of a few haplotypes to recombine dozens of polygenic alleles of small effect. Moreover, extensive pleiotropy means selection on one trait will have unintended consequences, exemplified by the negative trade-off between yield and protein content, unless selection and recombination can break unfavorable trait-trait associations.},

            Viticulture has to cope with climate change and to decrease pesticide inputs, while maintaining yield and wine quality. Breeding is a key lever to meet this challenge, and genomic prediction a promising tool to accelerate breeding programs. Multivariate methods are potentially more accurate than univariate ones. Moreover, some prediction methods also provide marker selection, thus allowing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) detection and the identification of positional candidate genes. To study both genomic prediction and QTL detection for drought-related traits in grapevine, we applied several methods, interval mapping (IM) as well as univariate and multivariate penalized regression, in a bi-parental progeny. With a dense genetic map, we simulated two traits under four QTL configurations. The penalized regression method Elastic Net (EN) for genomic prediction, and controlling the marginal False Discovery Rate on EN selected markers to prioritize the QTLs. Indeed, penalized methods were more powerful than IM for QTL detection across various genetic architectures. Multivariate prediction did not perform better than its univariate counterpart, despite strong genetic correlation between traits. Using 14 traits measured in semi-controlled conditions under different watering conditions, penalized regression methods proved very efficient for intra-population prediction whatever the genetic architecture of the trait, with predictive abilities reaching 0.68. Compared to a previous study on the same traits, these methods applied on a denser map found new QTLs controlling traits linked to drought tolerance and provided relevant candidate genes. Overall, these findings provide a strong evidence base for implementing genomic prediction in grapevine breeding.},

	abstract = {Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is a major staple food crop worldwide. Genetic dissection of important agronomic traits is essential for continuous improvement of wheat yield to meet the demand of the world’s growing population. We conducted a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a panel of 768 wheat cultivars that were genotyped with 327 609 single-nucleotide polymorphisms generated by genotyping-by-sequencing and detected 395 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for 12 traits under 7 environments. Among them, 273 QTLs were delimited to \%1.0-Mb intervals and 7 of them are either known genes (Rht-D, Vrn-B1, and Vrn-D1) that have been cloned or known QTLs (TaGA2ox8, APO1, TaSus1-7B, and Rht12) that were previously mapped. Eight putative candidate genes were identiﬁed for three QTLs that enhance spike seed setting and grain size using gene expression data and were validated in three biparental populations. Protein sequence analysis identiﬁed 33 putative wheat orthologs that have high identity with rice genes in QTLs affecting similar traits. Large r2 values for additive effects observed among the QTLs for most traits indicated that the phenotypes of these identiﬁed QTLs were highly predictable. Results from this study demonstrated that signiﬁcantly increasing GWAS population size and marker density greatly improves detection and identiﬁcation of candidate genes underlying a QTL, solidifying the foundation for large-scale QTL ﬁne mapping, candidate gene validation, and developing functional markers for genomics-based breeding in wheat.},

            Exposure to UV-B radiation, an intrinsic component of solar light, is detrimental to all living organisms as chromophore units of DNA, RNA and proteins readily absorb high-energy photons. Indirect damage to the same molecules and lipids is mediated by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, a side effect of exposure to UV-B stress. To protect themselves from UV-B radiation, plants produce phytochemical sunscreens, among which flavonoids have shown to be particularly effective. The core aglycone of flavonoid molecules is subjected to chemical decoration, such as glycosylation and acylation, further improving sunscreen properties. In particular, acylation, which adds a phenolic ring to flavonoid molecules, enhances the spectral absorption of UV-A and UV-B rays, providing to this class of compounds exceptional shielding power. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the responses to UV-B radiation in four Brassicaceae species, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica napus, Brassica oleracea, and Brassica rapa. Our study revealed a complete reprogramming of the central metabolic pathway in response to UV-B radiation characterized by increased production of functional precursors of specialized metabolites with UV-B shielding properties, indicating a targeted effort of plant metabolism to provide increased protection. The analysis of specialized metabolites and transcripts revealed the activation of the phenylpropanoid–acetate pathway, leading to the production of specific classes of flavonoids and a cross-species increase in phenylacylated-flavonoid glucosides with synapoyl glycoside decorations. Interestingly, our analysis also revealed that acyltransferase genes of the class of serine carboxypeptidase-like (SCPLs) proteins are costitutively expressed, but downregulated in response to UV-B radiation, possibly independently of the ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) signaling pathway.},

Because the evolutionary past has favored certain combinations of traits, some strategies like fast growth with early flowering that are adaptive today are at odds with other plant resilience strategies such as elevated water use efficiency. We know that the evolution of trait combinations is shaped by genomic constraints, but it is unclear whether and how this is affected by natural selection from climate change. Growing hundreds of

            natural populations under different rainfall regimes revealed opposing natural selection on flowering time and water use efficiency, with strong antagonistic genetic correlations and contrasting causal alleles identified by Genome-Wide Association analyses.

              Plant diversity is shaped by trade-offs between traits related to competitive ability, propagule dispersal, and stress resistance. However, we still lack a clear understanding of how these trade-offs influence species distribution and population dynamics. In
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              , recent genetic analyses revealed a group of cosmopolitan genotypes that successfully recolonized Europe from its center after the last glaciation, excluding older (relict) lineages from the distribution except for their north and south margins. Here, we tested the hypothesis that cosmopolitans expanded due to higher colonization ability, while relicts persisted at the margins due to higher tolerance to competition and/or stress. We compared the phenotypic and genetic differentiation between 71 European genotypes originating from the center, and the south and north margins. We showed that a trade-off between plant fecundity and seed mass shapes the differentiation of
              A. thaliana
              in Europe, suggesting that the success of the cosmopolitan groups could be explained by their high dispersal ability. However, at both north and south margins, we found evidence of selection for alleles conferring low dispersal but highly competitive and stress-resistance abilities. This study sheds light on the role of ecological trade-offs as evolutionary drivers of the distribution and dynamics of plant populations.},

            Plants and insects have co-existed for almost 400 million years and their interactions can be beneficial or harmful, thus reflecting their intricate co-evolutionary dynamics. Many herbivorous arthropods cause tremendous crop loss, impacting the agro-economy worldwide. Plants possess an arsenal of chemical defenses that comprise diverse secondary metabolites that help protect against harmful herbivorous arthropods. In response, the strategies that herbivores use to cope with plant defenses can be behavioral, or molecular and/or biochemical of which salivary secretions are a key determinant. Insect salivary secretions/oral secretions (OSs) play a crucial role in plant immunity as they contain several biologically active elicitors and effector proteins that modulate plants’ defense responses. Using this oral secretion cocktail, insects overcome plant natural defenses to allow successful feeding. However, a lack of knowledge of the nature of the signals present in oral secretion cocktails has resulted in reduced mechanistic knowledge of their cellular perception. In this review, we discuss the latest knowledge on herbivore oral secretion derived elicitors and effectors and various mechanisms involved in plant defense modulation. Identification of novel herbivore-released molecules and their plant targets should pave the way for understanding the intricate strategies employed by both herbivorous arthropods and plants in their interactions.},

                  We review the need for increasing agricultural sustainability, how this can in part be delivered by positive biodiversity–ecosystem function (BEF) effects, the role within these of plant–plant facilitation, and how a better understanding of this role may help to deliver sustainable crop (particularly arable) production systems.
                
                
                  Major challenges facing intensive arable production include overall declines in biodiversity, poor soil structure and health, nutrient and soil particle run‐off, high greenhouse gas emissions, and increasing costs of synthetic inputs including herbicides, pesticides and fertilisers.
                
                
                  Biodiversity–ecosystem function effects have the potential to deliver win–wins for arable food production, whereby enhanced biodiversity is associated with ‘good outcomes’ for farming sustainability, albeit sometimes through negative BEF effects for some components of the system. Although it can be difficult to separate explicitly from niche differentiation, evidence indicates facilitation can be a key component of these BEF effects.
                
                
                  Explicit recognition of facilitation's role brings benefits to developing sustainable crop systems. First, it allows us to link fundamental ecological studies on the evolution of facilitation to the selection of traits that can enhance functioning in crop mixtures. Second, it provides us with analytical frameworks which can be used to bring structure and testable hypotheses to data derived from multiple (often independent) crop trials.
                
                
                  Before concrete guidance can be provided to the agricultural sector as to how facilitation might be enhanced in crop systems, challenges exist with respect to quantifying facilitation, understanding the traits that maximise facilitation and integrating these traits into breeding programmes, components of an approach we suggest could be termed ‘Functional Ecological Selection’.

Ultimately, better integration between ecologists and crop scientists will be essential in harnessing the benefits of ecological knowledge for developing more sustainable agriculture. We need to focus on understanding the mechanistic basis of strong facilitative interactions in crop systems and using this information to select and breed for improved combinations of genotypes and species as part of the Functional Ecological Selection approach.},

              The evolution in the definition of crop yield—from the ratio of seed harvested to seed sown to the contemporary measure of mass of seed per unit land area―has favoured less competitive phenotypes. Here we use binary mixtures of cultivars spanning five decades of selection for yield and agronomic adaptation to ask three questions. First, what is the degree of symmetry in the response of yield to neighbour; this is, if an older, more competitive cultivar increases yield by 10\% with a less competitive neighbour in comparison to pure stands, would the newer, less competitive cultivar reduce yield by 10\% when grown with older neighbour. Lack of symmetry would indicate factors other than competitive ability underly yield improvement. Second, what are the yield components underlying competitive interactions. Third, to what extent are the responses to neighbour mediated by radiation, water and nitrogen. A focus on yield components and resources can help the interpretation of shifts in the crop phenotype in response to selection for yield. The rate of genetic gain in yield over five decades was 24 kg ha
              −1
               year
              −1
              or 0.61\% year
              −1
              . A strongly symmetrical yield response to neighbour indicates that yield improvement closely associates with a reduction in competitive ability. Response to neighbour was larger for grain number and biomass than for grain weight and allocation of biomass to grain. Under our experimental conditions, competition for radiation was dominant compared to competition of water and nitrogen. High‐yielding phenotypes had lower competitive ability for radiation but compensated with higher radiation use efficiency, a measure of canopy photosynthetic efficiency. Genetic and agronomic manipulation of the crop phenotype to reduce competitive ability could further improve wheat yield to meet the challenge of global food security.},

            Of the various factors affecting nitrogen response in rice, plant form or plant type is particularly significant. Experiments were conducted during two crop seasons to study the N response and the growth characteristics of some traditional leafy tropical indica varieties and two dwarf indicas of improved plant type. Most of the traditional tall varieties lodged at certain growth stages, and yielded the best when 30 to 60 kg/ha N was applied. One of the dwarf varieties developed by the Institute produced progressively higher yields (the highest being 9,477 kg/ha) up to 120 kg/ha N in the sunny dry season. The increase in dry matter production from panicle initiation to harvest was significantly correlated with grain yield.

We studied an experimental gradient of plant species richness for a better understanding of plant–pollinator community interactions and their temporal variability, because in non‐experimental field surveys plant richness is often confounded with gradients in management, soil fertility, and community composition. We observed pollinator species richness and frequency of visits six times in 73 plots over two years, and used advanced statistical analysis to account for the high number of zeroes that often occur in count data of rare species. The frequency of pollinator visits increased linearly with both the blossom cover and the number of flowering plant species, which was closely related to the total number of plant species, whereas the number of pollinator species followed a saturation curve. The presence of particularly attractive plant species was only important for the frequency of flower visits, but not to the richness of pollinators. Plant species richness, blossom cover, and the presence of attractive plant species enhanced the temporal stability in the frequency of pollinator visits.
            In conclusion, grasslands with high plant diversity enhance and stabilize frequent and diverse flower visitations, which should sustain effective pollination and plant reproduction.},

	abstract = {Mixing crop cultivars has long been considered as a way to control epidemics at the field level and is experiencing a revival of interest in agriculture. Yet, the ability of mixing to control pests is highly variable and often unpredictable in the field. Beyond classical diversity effects such as dispersal barrier generated by genotypic diversity, several understudied processes are involved. Among them is the recently discovered neighbor-modulated susceptibility (NMS), which depicts the phenomenon that susceptibility in a given plant is affected by the presence of another healthy neighboring plant. Despite the putative tremendous importance of NMS for crop science, its occurrence and quantitative contribution to modulating susceptibility in cultivated species remains unknown. Here, in both rice and wheat inoculated in greenhouse conditions with foliar fungal pathogens considered as major threats, using more than 200 pairs of intraspecific genotype mixtures, we experimentally demonstrate the occurrence of NMS in 11\% of the mixtures grown in experimental conditions that precluded any epidemics. Thus, the susceptibility of these 2 major crops results from indirect effects originating from neighboring plants. Quite remarkably, the levels of susceptibility modulated by plant–plant interactions can reach those conferred by intrinsic basal immunity. These findings open new avenues to develop more sustainable agricultural practices by engineering less susceptible crop mixtures thanks to emergent but now predictable properties of mixtures.},

            In the era of ubiquitous high‐throughput sequencing studies, there is a growing need for analysis tools that are not just performant but also comprehensive and user‐friendly enough to cater to both novice and advanced users. This article introduces SeqKit2, the next iteration of the widely used sequence analysis tool SeqKit, featuring expanded functionality, performance optimizations, and support for additional compression methods. Retaining a pragmatic subcommand architecture, SeqKit2 represents substantial enhancement through the inclusion of 19 additional subcommands, expanding its overall repertoire to a total of 38 in eight categories. The new subcommands add functionality such as amplicon processing and robust, error‐tolerant parsing of sequence records. In addition, three subcommands designed for real‐time analysis are added for periodic monitoring of properties of FASTQ and Binary Alignment/Map alignment records and real‐time streaming from multiple sequence files. The performance of SeqKit2 is benchmarked against the old version of SeqKit, Bioawk, Seqtk, and SeqFu tools. SeqKit2 consistently outperforms its predecessor, albeit with marginally higher memory usage, while maintaining competitive runtimes against other tools. With its broad functionality, proven usability, and ongoing development driven by user feedback, we hope that bioinformaticians will find SeqKit2 useful as a “Swiss army knife” of sequence and alignment processing—equally adept at facilitating ad hoc analyses and seamlessly integrating into larger pipelines.

            Genotype-by-environment (G×E) interactions can significantly affect crop performance and stability. Investigating G×E requires extensive data sets with diverse cultivars tested over multiple locations and years. The Genomes-to-Fields (G2F) Initiative has tested maize hybrids in more than 130 year-locations in North America since 2014. Here, we curate and expand this data set by generating environmental covariates (using a crop model) for each of the trials. The resulting data set includes DNA genotypes and environmental data linked to more than 70,000 phenotypic records of grain yield and flowering traits for more than 4000 hybrids. We show how this valuable data set can serve as a benchmark in agricultural modeling and prediction, paving the way for countless G×E investigations in maize. We use multivariate analyses to characterize the data set’s genetic and environmental structure, study the association of key environmental factors with traits, and provide benchmarks using genomic prediction models.},

            Growing threats from extreme climatic events and biodiversity loss have raised concerns about their interactive consequences for ecosystem functioning. Evidence suggests biodiversity can buffer ecosystem functioning during such climatic events. However, whether exposure to extreme climatic events will strengthen the biodiversity-dependent buffering effects for future generations remains elusive. We assess such transgenerational effects by exposing experimental grassland communities to eight recurrent summer droughts versus ambient conditions in the field. Seed offspring of 12 species are then subjected to a subsequent drought event in the glasshouse, grown individually, in monocultures or in 2-species mixtures. Comparing productivity between mixtures and monocultures, drought-selected plants show greater between-species complementarity than ambient-selected plants when recovering from the subsequent drought, causing stronger biodiversity effects on productivity and better recovery of drought-selected mixtures after the drought. These findings suggest exposure to recurrent climatic events can improve ecosystem responses to future events through transgenerational reinforcement of species complementarity.},

            We present a novel approach to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by leveraging unstructured, spoken phenotypic descriptions to identify genomic regions associated with maize traits. Utilizing the Wisconsin Diversity panel, we collected spoken descriptions of Zea mays ssp. mays traits, converting these qualitative observations into quantitative data amenable to GWAS analysis. First, we determined that visually striking phenotypes could be detected from unstructured spoken phenotypic descriptions. Next, we developed two methods to process the same descriptions to derive the trait plant height, a well-characterized phenotypic feature in maize: (1) a semantic similarity metric that assigns a score based on the resemblance of each observation to the concept of ‘tallness’ and (2) a manual scoring system that categorizes and assigns values to phrases related to plant height. Our analysis successfully corroborated known genomic associations and uncovered novel candidate genes potentially linked to plant height. Some of these genes are associated with gene ontology terms that suggest a plausible involvement in determining plant stature. This proof-of-concept demonstrates the viability of spoken phenotypic descriptions in GWAS and introduces a scalable framework for incorporating unstructured language data into genetic association studies. This methodology has the potential not only to enrich the phenotypic data used in GWAS and to enhance the discovery of genetic elements linked to complex traits but also to expand the repertoire of phenotype data collection methods available for use in the field environment.},

	abstract = {Background: Plant-parasitic nematodes developed strategies to invade and colonize their host plants, including expression of immune suppressors to overcome host defenses. Meloidogyne graminicola and M. incognita are root-knot nematode (RKN) species reported to damage rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivated in upland and irrigated systems. Despite M. incognita wide host range, study of the molecular plant - RKN interaction has been so far limited to a few dicotyledonous model plants. The aim of this study was to investigate if the rice cv. Nipponbare widely used in rice genomic studies could be used as a suitable monocotyledon host plant for studying M. incognita pathogenicity mechanisms. Here we compared the ability of M. graminicola and M. incognita to develop and reproduce in Nipponbare roots. Next, we tested if RKNs modulates rice immunity-related genes expression in galls during infection and express the Mi-crt gene encoding an immune suppressor.
Results: Root galling, mature females, eggs and newly formed J2s nematodes were obtained for both species in rice cultivated in hydroponic culture system after 4–5 weeks. Meloidogyne graminicola reproduced at higher rates than M. incognita on Nipponbare and the timing of infection was shorter. In contrast, the infection characteristics compared by histological analysis were similar for both nematode species. Giant cells formed from 2 days after infection (DAI) with M. graminicola and from 6 DAI with M. incognita. Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) data indicated that RKNs are able to suppress transcription of immune regulators genes, such as OsEDS1, OsPAD4 and OsWRKY13 in young galls. Four M. incognita reference genes (Mi-eif-3, Mi-GDP-2, Mi-Y45F10D.4, and Mi-actin) were selected for normalizing nematode gene expression studies in planta and in pre-parasitic J2s. Meloidogyne incognita expressed the immune suppressor calreticulin gene (Mi-crt) in rice roots all along its infection cycle.
Conclusion: RKNs repress the transcription of key immune regulators in rice, likely in order to lower basal defence in newly-formed galls. The calreticulin Mi-CRT can be one of the immune-modulator effectors secreted by M. incognita in rice root tissues. Together, these data show that rice is a well suited model system to study host- M. incognita molecular interactions in monocotyledons.},

            In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), a hypersensitive-like response (HR-like response) is triggered underneath the eggs of the large white butterfly Pieris brassicae (P. brassicae), and this response is dependent on salicylic acid (SA) accumulation and signaling. Previous reports indicate that the clade I L-type LECTIN RECEPTOR KINASE-I.8 (LecRK-I.8) is involved in early steps of egg recognition. A genome-wide association study was used to better characterize the genetic structure of the HR-like response and discover loci that contribute to this response. We report here the identification of LecRK-I.1, a close homolog of LecRK-I.8, and show that two main haplotypes that explain part of the variation in HR-like response segregate among natural Arabidopsis accessions. Besides, signatures of balancing selection at this locus suggest that it may be ecologically important. Disruption of LecRK-I.1 results in decreased HR-like response and SA signaling, indicating that this protein is important for the observed responses. Furthermore, we provide evidence that LecRK-I.1 functions in the same signaling pathway as LecRK-I.8. Altogether, our results show that the response to eggs of P. brassicae is controlled by multiple LecRKs.},

                    Herbivore‐induced defences in plants are considered a strategy to manage multiple interactions while saving resources. The optimal defence theory (
                    ODT
                    ) is one of the most prominent theoretical frameworks to explain the defence allocation patterns within plants. It was recently shown that the
                    ODT
                    generally applies to constitutive glucosinolate (
                    GSL
                    ) allocation in shoot and root organs. Previous studies showed that both root and shoot herbivore feeding may alter defence allocation over plant organs. For shoots, the effect depends on where the herbivores feed. It is as yet unknown whether similar principles apply to root‐herbivore‐induced
                    GSL
                    s.
                  
                
                
                  
                    To analyse the effects of root localized herbivore feeding on
                    GSL
                    allocation, we conducted a pot experiment using
                    Anomala cuprea
                    grubs and four Brassicaceae;
                    Brassica rapa
                    ,
                    B. nigra
                    ,
                    B. oleracea
                    and
                    Sinapis alba
                    . Individuals of these four plant species were grown in dedicated mesocosms. The grubs were confined either to the bottom soil, the middle section or the topsoil. Plants grown in the same set‐ups but without root herbivores served as controls. Glucosinolate levels of the leaf lamina, petiole and stem as well as of the taproot, lateral roots and fine roots were measured after 8 days of herbivory.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Plant biomass reduction due to herbivory was the largest when herbivores were confined to the topsoil. In the three
                    Brassica
                    species, taproot
                    GSL
                    levels increased upon herbivory independent of where the root herbivores were feeding. Glucosinolate levels in fine roots and shoots, on the other hand, hardly responded to root herbivory. Indole
                    GSL
                    s, which are more effective to pathogens than to herbivores, were more strongly induced than aliphatic and aromatic
                    GSL
                    s, especially in the taproots.
                    Sinapis alba

                    These results show that locally and systemically induced defences in roots are consistent with the

                    : The taproot which is the most vulnerable and valuable to plant performance shows the highest increase in defence induction. The induced

                    Optimal defence allocation theory (
                    ODT
                    ) is one of the most prominent theoretical frameworks to explain the allocation of defence compounds within plants. It predicts that the most valuable and vulnerable plant organs have the highest levels of chemical defence. The
                    ODT
                    has been well worked out and experimentally tested for shoot defences, but not for root defences. To assess if
                    ODT
                    principles apply similarly to roots and shoots, we examined glucosinolates in above‐ground and below‐ground organs of nine plant species belonging to two families.
                  
                
                
                  
                    In order to evaluate whether
                    ODT
                    equally applies to shoot and root organs, we designed a conceptual model in which above‐ground and below‐ground organs were assigned to orders of importance to plant performance. We hypothesized that organs constituting the plant's core structure are better protected than more distal organs.
                  
                
                
                  
                    The nine plant species were cultivated, and their roots and shoots were harvested and divided into three orders for glucosinolate analysis. Using a specialist (
                    Delia radicum
                    ) and a generalist (
                    Amphimallon solstitiale
                    ) root herbivore, we also experimentally tested the hypothesis that the generalist herbivore prefers to feed on fine roots (FRs) with a low glucosinolate concentration, while the specialist prefers taproots (TRs) with a high glucosinolate concentration.
                  
                
                
                  We found that both in roots and shoots, the higher ordered core structural organs (TRs and stems) had the highest levels of glucosinolates. Below‐ground, TRs and lateral roots were better protected than the more distal, and less costly, FRs in seven out of nine species tested. The specialist root herbivore preferred feeding on the highly defended TRs, which is in line with what has been found for above‐ground specialist herbivores. Moreover, the glucosinolate concentration in roots overall was significantly higher than that in shoots.
                
                
                  
                    Synthesis

                    Optimal defence allocation theory (ODT)
                    generally applies to glucosinolate allocation in above‐ground and below‐ground organs and may mainly serve to maintain the integrity of the main plant structure. Moreover, it suggests that above‐ground and below‐ground insect herbivores independently exert similar selection pressures on defence allocation patterns in roots and shoots.},

	abstract = {Plants can defend themselves to pathogen and herbivore attack by responding to chemical signals that are emitted by attacked plants. It is well established that such signals can be transferred through the air. In theory, plants can also communicate with each other through underground common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) that interconnect roots of multiple plants. However, until now research focused on plant-to-plant carbon nutrient movement and there is no evidence that defense signals can be exchanged through such mycorrhizal hyphal networks. Here, we show that CMNs mediate plantplant communication between healthy plants and pathogen-infected tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). After establishment of CMNs with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae between tomato plants, inoculation of ‘donor’ plants with the pathogen Alternaria solani led to increases in disease resistance and activities of the putative defensive enzymes, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, chitinase, b-1,3-glucanase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and lipoxygenase in healthy neighbouring ‘receiver’ plants. The uninfected ‘receiver’ plants also activated six defence-related genes when CMNs connected ‘donor’ plants challenged with A. solani. This finding indicates that CMNs may function as a plant-plant underground communication conduit whereby disease resistance and induced defence signals can be transferred between the healthy and pathogen-infected neighbouring plants, suggesting that plants can ‘eavesdrop’ on defence signals from the pathogen-challenged neighbours through CMNs to activate defences before being attacked themselves.},

Between 2007 and 2013, prolonged outbreaks of barley powdery mildew (BPM) occurred.

This review highlights the steps taken to reduce losses to BPM, breeding efforts to introduce resistance into cultivars and the success of pre-­breeding research to find new and durable resistance genes.

                  The vulnerability of trees to insect herbivory can be influenced by forest structure and diversity. Associational resistance theory posits that trees surrounded by diverse neighbours are likely to suffer reduced herbivory. However, the underlying mechanisms of this effect are debated, with accumulating evidence suggesting that leaf traits could mediate the strength and direction of the diversity‐herbivory relationships.
                
                
                  To determine the role of tree trait variation in mediating this relationship, we measured leaf herbivory and nine morphological and nutritional leaf traits known to influence herbivory on 394 focal trees of twelve species cultivated in monocultures and mixtures of four, eight, and sixteen species in a 4‐year‐old large‐scale manipulated tree diversity experiment.
                
                
                  A reduction in the proportion of focal trees in species‐rich neighbourhoods resulted in increased leaf carbon: nitrogen ratio of focal trees, which mediated a reduction in insect herbivory. Moreover, an increase in plant height apparency, defined as the disparity in total height between a focal tree and its closest neighbours, indirectly amplified herbivory by reducing leaf phosphorus concentration.
                
                
                  
                    Synthesis
                    : The study suggests that neighbourhood diversity and physical structure can indirectly affect herbivory on a focal plant by modifying its leaf trait. Accounting for the functional differences between forests could enhance our understanding of diversity–herbivory relationships.},

Negative sexual interactions between species (reproductive interference) through improper heterospecific pollen transfer have recently been reported between native and invasive species demonstrating pollination‐driven competition. We focused on two native
              Impatiens
              species (
              I. noli‐tangere
              and
              I. textori
              ) found in Japan and examined whether pollinator‐mediated plant competition occurs between them. We demonstrate that
              I. noli‐tangere
              and
              I. textori
              share the same pollination niche (i.e., flowering season, pollinator fauna, and position of pollen on the pollinator's body). In addition, heterospecific pollen grains were deposited on most stigmas of both
              I. noli‐tangere
              and
              I. textori
              flowers that were situated within 2 m of flowers of the other species resulting in depressed fruit set. Further, by hand‐pollination experiments, we show that when as few as 10\% of the pollen grains are heterospecific, fruit set is decreased to less than half in both species. These results show that intensive pollinator‐mediated competition occurs between
              I. noli‐tangere
              and
              I. textori
              . This study suggests that intensive pollinator‐mediated competition occurs in the wild even when interacting species are both native and not invasive.},

              Theoretical studies have predicted that reproductive interference must exclude either of the interacting species, but no testing of this prediction has ever been reported for natural populations. This study surveyed the distribution patterns of herbaceous
              Veronica
              plants, including one native and three alien species, to test whether the invasion of the alien species exerting reproductive interference excluded the native species. Results showed that the native species was repeatedly excluded from islands where an alien species invaded, exerting reproductive interference, and that other alien species had no significant effect on the native population survival. This survey also demonstrated that the native species altered its habitat from the ground to stone walls on the mainland where the alien species had been predominant. In the mainland populations, the fruit morphology differed from that of the islands, and the morphology in the mainland population seemed suitable for seed dispersion by ants at a stone wall habitat. We also surveyed the genetic differentiation among populations, the results of which did not support the native species genetically differentiated between mainland and island populations before the alien species invasion. These results strongly suggest that the reproductive interference excluded the recipient species at the population level and facilitated the habitat change. Additionally, results indicated that a series of field surveys of islands close to the mainland can be a powerful tool to test the ecological importance of reproductive interference.},

                    Viscum album
                    is a widespread obligate hemiparasite on a wide range of angiosperm and gymnosperm trees. Once thought to take just water and nutrients from its host via a haustorium, it is now suggested to also take carbon. Heavy infestations can reduce host vitality through prolific water use and carbon removal.
                  
                
                
                  Flowers are highly reduced but are primarily pollinated by flies, ants and bees. Seeds are dispersed by birds. Removal of the epicarp is necessary for successful seedling establishment, and seeds have a sticky viscin coat, adhering it to the host bark. Vegetative spread also happens under the bark of its host resulting in densities of {\textgreater}700 Mistletoe plants per host.

                    is a lowland species, most frequent in open human‐made habitats extending into woodlands in Europe. It has been widely planted for folklore use centred around Christmas. Despite conservation concerns following removal of Mistletoe‐laden old orchards, the species is thriving and needs control in some areas. Viscotoxins and lectins in leaves and shoots have been widely used in herbal medicine and now potentially in complementary cancer therapy.},

In the system of plant species, however, the border with the pollen limitation has often been vague in past studies. This study, using field and laboratory experiments and field observations, examined the reproductive success of an endangered native herbaceous plant, Veronica polita lilacina, in the context of the reproductive interference by the alien congener, V. persica. The auto-pollination experiment confirmed that both species can usually produce seeds even without external conspecific pollens. Results of the artificial pollination experiment demonstrated that pollination with the heterospecific pollens significantly decreases the number of seeds in the native species, but not in the alien species. A transplant experiment revealed that the coexistence with the alien species reduced the fruiting success of the native species. Field observations have shown the interaction between two species in the native patch with only one intruding alien species. They demonstrated that native individuals placed closer to the alien individual suffered a greater decrease in fruiting success and the seed production and that the alien intruder produced no seed. These results demonstrate that species that could reproduce via the auto-pollination suffered the reproductive interference and that the native species also exert the resistive reproductive interference slightly. These interactions can explain the displacement pattern of the native species by the alien congener in Japan.},

Winged seeds must be lifted above the canopy by updrafts to have a chance of further dispersal in high velocity horizontal winds aloft or in landscape‐scale convection cells. Shear‐induced turbulent eddies of a scale up to one‐third of canopy height provide a lifting mechanism. Preliminary data suggest that all seeds of a given species may be viable candidates for uplift and long‐distance dispersal, despite the evidence that slow‐falling seeds are dispersed farther under any given wind conditions. Turbulence is argued more often and more extensively to advance long‐distance dispersal than to retard it. Seeds may take advantage of ‘Bernoulli sailing’ to move with faster than average winds. Elasticity of branches and trees may play a role in regulating the release of seeds into unusually favorable winds. Dispersal is at least biphasic, and the study of long‐distance dispersal calls for mixed models and mixed methods of gathering data.},

                  The process of seed dispersal that underpins ecosystem maintenance is performed by diverse arrays of fruit‐eating animals. However, seed dispersal studies are primarily focused on a subset of these animal communities that disperse seeds by endozoochory. Stomatochory (seed dispersal in which seeds are carried externally and are not swallowed) is rarely considered to be effective, despite an increasing number of taxa‐focused studies that indicate otherwise.
                
                
                  We collated the available information on stomatochory to provide a quantitative overview of the dispersal mechanism, including plant types and fruit traits dispersed, dispersal distances and germination potential for all available taxa. We compared seed sizes dispersed, dispersal distances and germination potential with corresponding data on endozoochory for bats and primates. We also identified the main taxa dispersing seeds by stomatochory and assessed what factors influenced the distances that they carried seeds to.
                
                
                  Stomatochoric dispersers can displace large quantities of seeds, including large seeds and those of large fruits, and over short to long distances ({\textgreater}1 km). Compared with similar‐sized endozoochoric dispersers, they can disperse larger seeds, but over shorter distances, on average. Similar to endozoochory, seed handling by stomatochory also improves the germination potential of dispersed seeds. Dispersal distances achieved by stomatochory were influenced by body mass, daily path length, seed width, fruit type and seed handling techniques.
                
                
                  Five main taxonomic groups of stomatochoric dispersers were identified: bats, parrots, squirrels, corvids and Old World monkeys (cercopithecines). Parrots perform dispersal services for the largest fruits and over the longest distances. However, given the lack of research on stomatochory, it is likely other taxa are also important stomatochoric dispersers but have not been identified yet.
                
                
                  More research attention must be directed towards seed dispersal services that are not provided by endozoochory. Many stomatochoric dispersers are common animals within communities and could be playing dominant seed dispersal roles, even without swallowing seeds. Community‐wide studies should incorporate all seed dispersal interactions, rather than focusing solely on endozoochory. This will ensure a more robust understanding of community‐wide patterns.

We then tested several types of regressions to each set of data to find the best‐fitting line accounting for the observed relationship between pollinator response and display size. We found that the visitation rate of bumble bees per plant was a decelerating function of floral display, and that the number of flowering heads visited on a plant increased linearly with display size. Predicted from the above two functions, the visitation rate per head was independent of floral display and nearly constant within each day. Our results suggest that conventional methods in collecting and analyzing data on pollinator visitation may yield large variance in data derived from temporal and spatial heterogeneity and that improved methods employed here are effective in reducing the variance and estimating patterns of pollinator response to floral display more accurately.},

                     We analysed the longevity of individual flowers and the effect on pollination success with respect to floral display size of racemes (number of flowers open at one time) for the sequentially blooming plant
                    Narthecium asiaticum
                    (Liliaceae). The longevity of lower‐ and middle‐positioned flowers (about 7 days in 1998 and 6 days in 1999) was much greater than the length of time required for the completion of male (about 3 days) and female (within 3 days) functions.
                  
                
                
                   We suggest that such prolonged longevity benefits the plant in terms of pollinator attraction, because prolonged longevity in lower and middle flowers leads to large display sizes of racemes. Increased display size would not have resulted in an increase of geitonogamy in this species, because most pollinators left racemes after probing only one flower. Rather, large displays attracted more pollinators and increased pollen dispersal from individual flowers.
                
                
                   The longevity of upper‐positioned flowers (about 4 days in 1998 and 3 days in 1999) was less than that of lower‐ and middle‐positioned flowers – almost the same as the length of time required for the completion of male and female functions. This difference is possibly because upper flowers open later within racemes: if there were no subsequent flowers, prolonged floral longevity would not benefit the plants and would only consume resources used to maintain the flower.
                
                
                   Floral longevity within inflorescence should be understood in relation to the effects of floral display size and floral positions, in addition to the accrual rates of male and female functions and the maintenance cost of individual flowers.},

              1. We analysed how male and female success affects the floral longevity in
              Erythronium japonicum
              . We found that flower senescence is advanced by deposition of pollen grains on the stigma but that there exists a minimum longevity (13·64 days in 1996 and 12·20 days in 1997) during which the flower never abscises, even if it is pollinated with a sufficient number of pollen grains.
            
            2. We suggest that this floral longevity does not exist to benefit the female function, because the time needed for corolla abscission reacting to ovule fertilization was not so long and the female function was completed within about 3 days.
            
              3. Flowers of
              E. japonicum
              do not react to pollen removal, as shown by the fact that anther removal experiments did not affect floral longevity. However, it would be advantageous to have some duration of longevity which benefits male success such that most of pollen grains can be expected to be exported. The duration needed to disperse most pollen grains of a flower was about 12 days, very close to the minimum floral longevity.
            
            4. We conclude that a minimum longevity may exist for male functions and that floral longevity may be influenced differently by the male and the female functions of flowers.},

            Finlay–Wilkinson regression is a popular method for analysing genotype–environment interaction in series of plant breeding and variety trials. It involves a regression on the environmental mean, indexing the productivity of an environment, which is driven by a wide array of environmental factors. Increasingly, it is becoming feasible to characterize environments explicitly using observable environmental covariates. Hence, there is mounting interest to replace the environmental index with an explicit regression on such observable environmental covariates. This paper reviews the development of such methods. The focus is on parsimonious models that allow replacing the environmental index by regression on synthetic environmental covariates formed as linear combinations of a larger number of observable environmental covariates. Two new methods are proposed for obtaining such synthetic covariates, which may be integrated into genotype‐specific regression models, that is, criss‐cross regression and a factor‐analytic approach. The main advantage of such explicit modelling is that predictions can be made also for new environments where trials have not been conducted. A published dataset is employed to illustrate the proposed methods.},

For each variety a linear regression of yield on the mean yield of all varieties for each site and season was computed to measure variety adaptation. In these calculations the basic yields were measured on a logarithmic scale, as it was found that a high degree of linearity was thereby induced. The mean yield of all varieties for each site and season provided a quantitative grading of the environments; and from the analysis described, varieties specifically adapted to good or poor seasons and those showing general adaptability may be identified. The study of the adaptation of the whole population of varieties was facilitated by the use of a two-dimensional plot (scatter diagram), with mean yield and regression coefficient as coordinates for each variety. Though wide variation was evident in both mean yield and sensitivity to environment as characterized by the regression coefficient, the variation in sensitivity was proportionately less among varieties with higher mean yield, and the varieties with highest mean yield exhibited, within very narrow limits (regression coefficients close to 0.8), a similar degree of adaptation to all environments over the wide range, especially of seasonal conditions, typical of the South Australian cereal belt. Varieties from particular geographic regions of the world showed a similarity in type of adaptation, which provides a useful basis for plant introduction. Phenotypic stability and physiological and morphological characteristics of groups of varieties with specific or general adaptability are discussed in relation to plant introduction and breeding.},

              Associational effects, whereby plants influence the biotic interactions of their neighbors, are an important component of plant–insect interactions. Plant chemistry has been hypothesized to mediate these interactions. The role of chemistry in associational effects, however, has been unclear in part because the diversity of plant chemistry makes it difficult to tease apart the importance and roles of particular classes of compounds. We examined the chemical ecology of associational effects using backcross‐bred plants of the
              Solanum pennellii
              introgression lines. We used eight genotypes from the introgression line system to establish 14 unique neighborhood treatments that maximized differences in acyl sugars, proteinase inhibitor, and terpene chemical diversity. We found that the chemical traits of the neighboring plant, rather than simply the number of introgression lines within a neighborhood, influenced insect abundance on focal plants. Furthermore, within‐chemical class diversity had contrasting effects on herbivore and predator abundances, and depended on the frequency of neighboring plant chemotypes. Notably, we found insect mobility—flying versus crawling—played a key role in insect response to phytochemistry. We highlight that the frequency and chemical phenotype of plant neighbors underlie associational effects and suggest this may be an important mechanism in maintaining intraspecific phytochemical variation within plant populations.},

            Natural variation in trichome pattern (amount and distribution) is prominent among populations of many angiosperms. However, the degree of parallelism in the genetic mechanisms underlying this diversity and its environmental drivers in different species remain unclear. To address these questions, we analyzed the genomic and environmental bases of leaf trichome pattern diversity in Cardamine hirsuta, a relative of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We characterized 123 wild accessions for their genomic diversity, leaf trichome patterns at different temperatures, and environmental adjustments. Nucleotide diversities and biogeographical distribution models identified two major genetic lineages with distinct demographic and adaptive histories. Additionally, C. hirsuta showed substantial variation in trichome pattern and plasticity to temperature. Trichome amount in C. hirsuta correlated positively with spring precipitation but negatively with temperature, which is opposite to climatic patterns in A. thaliana. Contrastingly, genetic analysis of C. hirsuta glabrous accessions indicated that, like for A. thaliana, glabrousness is caused by null mutations in ChGLABRA1 (ChGL1). Phenotypic genome-wide association studies (GWAS) further identified a ChGL1 haplogroup associated with low trichome density and ChGL1 expression. Therefore, a ChGL1 series of null and partial loss-of-function alleles accounts for the parallel evolution of leaf trichome pattern in C. hirsuta and A. thaliana. Finally, GWAS also detected other candidate genes (e.g. ChETC3, ChCLE17) that might affect trichome pattern. Accordingly, the evolution of this trait in C. hirsuta and A. thaliana shows partially conserved genetic mechanisms but is likely involved in adaptation to different environments.},

              Natural variation has become a prime resource to identify genetic variants that contribute to phenotypic variation. The regional mapping (RegMap) population is one of the most important populations for studying natural variation in
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              , and has been used in a large number of association studies and in studies on climatic adaptation. However, only 413 RegMap accessions have been completely sequenced, as part of the 1001 Genomes (1001G) Project, while the remaining 894 accessions have only been genotyped with the Affymetrix 250k chip. As a consequence, most association studies involving the RegMap are either restricted to the sequenced accessions, reducing power, or rely on a limited set of SNPs. Here we impute millions of SNPs to the 894 accessions that are exclusive to the RegMap, using the 1135 accessions of the 1001G Project as the reference panel. We assess imputation accuracy using a novel cross‐validation scheme, which we show provides a more reliable measure of accuracy than existing methods. After filtering out low accuracy SNPs, we obtain high‐quality genotypic information for 2029 accessions and 3 million markers. To illustrate the benefits of these imputed data, we reconducted genome‐wide association studies on five stress‐related traits and could identify novel candidate genes.

            Classic genome-wide association studies (GWAS) look for associations between individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phenotypes of interest. With the rapid progress of high-throughput genotyping and phenotyping technologies, GWAS have become increasingly powerful for detecting genetic determinants and their molecular mechanisms underpinning natural phenotypic variation. However, GWAS frequently yield results with neither expected nor promising loci, nor any significant associations. This is often because associations between SNPs and a single phenotype are confounded, for example with the environment, other traits or complex genetic structures. Such confounding can mask true genotype–phenotype associations, or inflate spurious associations. To address these problems, numerous methods have been developed that go beyond the standard model. Such advanced GWAS models are flexible and can offer improved statistical power for understanding the genetics underlying complex traits. Despite this advantage, these models have not been widely adopted and implemented compared to the standard GWAS approach, partly because this literature is diverse and often technical. In this review, our aim is to provide an overview of the application and the benefits of various advanced GWAS models for handling complex traits and genetic structures, targeting plant biologists who wish to carry out GWAS more effectively.},

            Genotype-by-environment (G × E) interactions are important for understanding genotype–phenotype relationships. To date, various statistical models have been proposed to account for G × E effects, especially in genomic selection (GS) studies. Generally, GS does not focus on the detection of each quantitative trait locus (QTL), while the genome-wide association study (GWAS) was designed for QTL detection. G × E modeling methods in GS can be included as covariates in GWAS using unified linear mixed models (LMMs). However, the efficacy of G × E modeling methods in GS studies has not been evaluated for GWAS. In this study, we performed a comprehensive comparison of LMMs that integrate the G × E modeling methods to detect both QTL and QTL-by-environment (Q × E) interaction effects. Model efficacy was evaluated using simulation experiments. For the fixed effect terms representing Q × E effects, simultaneous scoring of specific and nonspecific environmental effects was recommended because of the higher recall and improved genomic inflation factor value. For random effects, it was necessary to account for both G × E and genotype-by-trial (G × T) effects to control genomic inflation factor value. Thus, the recommended LMM includes fixed QTL effect terms that simultaneously score specific and nonspecific environmental effects and random effects accounting for both G × E and G × T. The LMM was applied to real tomato phenotype data obtained from two different cropping seasons. We detected not only QTLs with persistent effects across the cropping seasons but also QTLs with Q × E effects. The optimal LMM identified in this study successfully detected more QTLs with Q × E effects.},

              A dense set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) covering the genome and an efficient method to assess SNP genotypes are expected to be available in the near future. An outstanding question is how to use these technologies efficiently to identify genes affecting liability to complex disorders. To achieve this goal, we propose a statistical method that has several optimal properties: It can be used with case‐control data and yet, like family‐based designs, controls for population heterogeneity; it is insensitive to the usual violations of model assumptions, such as cases failing to be strictly independent; and, by using Bayesian outlier methods, it circumvents the need for Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, leading to better performance in many settings while still constraining risk for false positives. The performance of our genomic control method is quite good for plausible effects of liability genes, which bodes well for future genetic analyses of complex disorders.},

The biological activity persisted after HIPVs had been oxidized to form SOAs, which was indicated by receivers displaying enhanced photosynthesis, primed volatile defenses, and reduced weevil damage. The elemental composition and quantity of SOAs likely determines their biological functions. This work demonstrates that plant-derived SOAs can mediate interactions between plants, highlighting their ecological significance in ecosystems.

              Plants release volatiles in response to herbivory, and these chemicals can act as cues for nearby plants to initiate chemical defenses to herbivores. However, volatiles can quickly oxidize into secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). Yu
              et al
              . found that SOAs, which can persist longer than the original volatiles, also serve as signals for neighboring plants. Volatiles produced by pine seedlings in response to underground feeding by weevils and their resulting SOAs induced responses in neighboring seedlings, including heightened defenses, less herbivore damage, and higher photosynthesis. The relevance of SOAs for plant-plant interactions has thus been underestimated. —Bianca Lopez},

            Plants are typically surrounded by neighboring individuals in agricultural fields or natural environments. In such circumstances, plant-plant interactions (PPI) are ubiquitous and represent not only important evolutionary forces but also have consequences on (agro-)ecosystem functioning, such as increased productivity and resistance. However, many mechanisms underlying these PPIs remain poorly understood. Recently, new genomic technologies and tools, such as genome-wide association studies, have facilitated genetic approaches to study PPIs, particularly among conspecific individuals. Here, we highlight emerging issues and advances in the field by focusing on three different aspects. First, we overview the current status of genetic mapping studies on PPIs and pinpoint that these studies open a new opportunity that is relevant to agriculture and breeding. Second, we introduce two proof-of-concept studies in Arabidopsis thaliana, in which genetic differences among plants improved the functioning of genotype mixtures. Both studies were able to predict effective mixtures with different experimental designs applied to different outcomes (productivity increase vs. herbivory mitigation). Third, we discuss implications from these case studies about how PPIs have cascading effects that propagate to higher levels of biological organization, such as populations or communities. At the population level, plant yield or resistance can be optimized through breeding that achieves reduced competition or push-pull protection systems, respectively. At the community level, these population-level changes may have further beneficial effects on plant-associated organisms. Overall, we suggest that the increasing availability of genomic resources will improve our understanding of PPIs and thereby contribute to the management of crops or semi-natural ecosystems.},

	abstract = {It is clear that the majority of flowering plants are pollinated by insects and other animals, with a minority utilising abiotic pollen vectors, mainly wind. However there is no accurate published calculation of the proportion of the ca 352 000 species of angiosperms that interact with pollinators. Widely cited figures range from 67\% to 96\% but these have not been based on firm data. We estimated the number and proportion of flowering plants that are pollinated by animals using published and unpublished community‐level surveys of plant pollination systems that recorded whether each species present was pollinated by animals or wind. The proportion of animal‐pollinated species rises from a mean of 78\% in temperate‐zone communities to 94\% in tropical communities. By correcting for the latitudinal diversity trend in flowering plants, we estimate the global number and proportion of animal pollinated angiosperms as 308 006, which is 87.5\% of the estimated species‐level diversity of flowering plants. Given current concerns about the decline in pollinators and the possible resulting impacts on both natural communities and agricultural crops, such estimates are vital to both ecologists and policy makers. Further research is required to assess in detail the absolute dependency of these plants on their pollinators, and how this varies with latitude and community type, but there is no doubt that plant–pollinator interactions play a significant role in maintaining the functional integrity of most terrestrial ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Interactions between plants and herbivores are central in most ecosystems, but their strength is highly variable. The amount of variability within a system is thought to influence most aspects of plant-herbivore biology, from ecological stability to plant defense evolution. Our understanding of what influences variability, however, is limited by sparse data. We collected standardized surveys of herbivory for 503 plant species at 790 sites across 116° of latitude. With these data, we show that within-population variability in herbivory increases with latitude, decreases with plant size, and is phylogenetically structured. Differences in the magnitude of variability are thus central to how plant-herbivore biology varies across macroscale gradients. We argue that increased focus on interaction variability will advance understanding of patterns of life on Earth.

            Editor’s summary
            Herbivory is a major selection pressure on plants, which have evolved many different physical and chemical adaptations to prevent animals from eating their tissues. However, herbivory pressure can be highly variable, even between plants in the same population. The Herbivory Variability Network consortium used standardized surveys to compare herbivory variability within populations at 790 sites across five continents. They found that the weak increase in mean herbivory at lower latitudes was accompanied by lower variation between individuals. Smaller plant species had higher herbivory variability, which also showed a phylogenetic signal. These findings highlight how variation in species interactions can influence eco-evolutionary outcomes. —Bianca Lopez
